is this?\nStill don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss\nGoddamn, how real is this?\nI know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this\nEast Coast nigga, but how trill is this?\nStill don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss\n\nStone cold love, rose gold slugs\nI could afford it, I imported stone cold drugs\nStone cold, rolling stone, I'm a stoned nigga\nWrite it on my tombstone, I was stoned nigga\nDon't remember me as a wannabe New Orleans nigga\nSlash lean sipping, Tennessee nigga, nah\nInfluenced by Houston, hear it in my music\nA trill nigga to the truest, show you how to do this\nMy all gold grills give her cold chills\nSaid she's got a coke feel cause I'm so trill\nTwo dope boy scales, but I sold pills\nNo deal, put her on her feet, toenails\nThem vampires, them bloodsuckers, them thirsty killers\nWe 'bout it 'bout it, we rowdy rowdy, that Percy Miller\nFor really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla\nNo bounty hunters, I'm 'bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla\nGive me the title, then give me the cash\nFold it then bag it then move to the trap\nFollow my stash, stealing my swag\nNiggas is wickity wickity wack\nLike Kriss Kross, her lip gloss\nSlip-ons get slipped off\nMy bitch boss, Cristal\nWe smoking then thinking then burning that hash\nPuff it and pass, making it last\nWalk in my shoes and then cross in my path\nGame was for grabs, making 'em crash\nTook in a section ain't giving it back\nFuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life\nAn insight to my trill life\nClams\n\nGoddamn, how real is this?\nI know the whole world gon' be feeling this\nEast Coast nigga, but how trill is this?\nStill, don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss", "image":

gunshot, gonna lick a boy)\n(Gun cock, gunshot, gonna lick a boy)\n(Gun cock, gunshot, gonna lick a boy)\n'Cause every day we on our pesos\n\nYo, yo, yo, your bitch just said I'm hot, man I told her I agree\nShe gon' really think I'm hot if I told her my degrees\nPull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys\nGraduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees\nCouple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's\nPopping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G\nA.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve\nBut I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe\nInhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills\nImport, export, Harlem catching rec still\nSo mami, show me how that neck feel (Feel)\nLater show me how the rest feel, for now just chill\n\nThis is the way it goes, this is the way we roll\n'Cause every day we on our pesos\nThis is the way it goes, this is the way we roll\n'Cause every day we on our pesos\n(Gun cock, gunshot, gonna lick a boy)\n(Gun cock, gunshot, gonna lick a boy)\n(Gun cock, gunshot, gonna lick a boy)\n'Cause every day we on our pesos\n'Cause every day we on our pesos\n'Cause every day we on our pesos", "image":

these niggas must be loco\nSteppin' on these bricks and for your fix so call me Toto\nFollow me, follow me, follow me now\n\nNow I'mma come through getting down\nGot a new Cadillac with a diamond in the back\nGot a bitch and she bad with about a hundred tats\nGot my goons on deck, and we got a hundred straps\nWhat you know about that, got me swaggin' to the max\nEverybody know we got the shit and baggages to match\nBetter come correct, fuck what the basis is\nGold grills like a set of new braces\n\nWhy they comment on my set though, they lookin' cause my neck gold\nAnd I let that Tec show... hear that echo?\nLet go, that medal, .38 special, to your threshold\nNiggas actin' petro, like they sexual, was metro\nBunch of bad bitches fuckin' out on tour\nLike it through the back door, give it to her raw\nShimmy shimmy ya: ODB, ODB\nFuckin' other niggas' broads: OPP, OPP\n\nComin' down stuntin' like a bitch, bitches on my dick\nOn the set and they like the nicotine to cigarette\nHow they fiending for a nigga got these hoes up on my sack\nGot my niggas in the back, couple bitches in the bed\nASAP where it's at, where that weed, how that cake\nBitches all up in my face, back back, give

purple (ASAP) (Swag, swag, swag)\nI said\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)\n\nIt be that pretty mothafucka' sipping that throwed\nGripping my pistol, my chrome\nHidden to hit you then splitting your wig into something\nI spit it and flip it like Bone\nNiggas ain't ready for the flow switch\nOnly Harlem nigga on his Bone shit\nTippin 4s since back in 06\nWon't you see a nigga getting throwed bitch?\nTwo middle fingers to the showbiz\nCause they selfish in the showbiz\nCause they shelf kids and it's hopeless\nCareer dying quicker than a goldfish\nI be the fly young fella (yeah!), Maison Martin Margiela (ugh)\nBitches Cinderellas under my umbrella, I go and tell her\n\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)\nI said\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)\n\nUgh! All hell here, bitch it's Satan talking\nTold her to take it off, give her the D, she take the offense\nSkinny nigga balling, trip but never falling\nWho said to make it rain (rain)? Bitch I make it pouring\nI'm a cake-o-saurus, go study my nature\nBig chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature\nFuck what you saying, no way\nA hater don't faze a gangster\nBrought up in danger, all about paper\nSmoking on purple, bitch, I'm dangerous\nNasty crazy, 90s baby, momma I made it\nUp to the sky, goodbye to the pavement\nHoes get caught in amazement\nI'm stuck in my ways\nSo fuck 'em up, I fuck 'em and duck 'em for days\nWhat more can I say? I'm chasing this paper\nThat's purple, nigga"}}, {"title": "Get Lit", "album": "LIVE.LOVE.A$AP", "year": "2011-10-31", "lyrics": "I get so high, I touch the sky 'til I can't even function\nI get so

mothafuckin' niggas who ain't wit us, keep it trilla'\nMy gold teeth, my french braids, getting throwed since 10th grade\nWealth is in the mind, not the pocket, if that's the case, then I been paid\nHerringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change\nYou bitch made, I'm old school, like gem stars and switchblades\nI spit game, I get paid, a pimp game\nI be, I be that pretty muthafucka, A$AP is just my nickname\n(I'm comin' down when I'm tippin' on them 4's\nCause we shittin' on these, shittin' on these niggas and these hoes)\nCause that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up\nI get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up\nTop of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind\nWe runnin', we runnin', we gunnin', we gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time\nThem bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe\nA weirdo but I'm real though\n\nAll these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em\nNot a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em\nGoing broke is not an option, always on that cash flow\nShe used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low\nFuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke\nA$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow\nI slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up\nThat's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch\nI'm headed to the future, Twelvyy ain't no loser\nMixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster\nI'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up\nI ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up\nI lucked up, I see it as a come up\nI'm on my job man, I see you when the sun's up\nHuh, young niggas run everything\nA$AP to the top and these bitches love everything\n\nGod bless America, my flow is scarier\nStyle wild like my nigga Common after Erykah\nYour bitch, I'm in bed with her, head so good\nMake a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her\nBut I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit\nI be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?\nHoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard\nEast coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise\nI know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers\nFashion killa' word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya\nStill sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in\nKitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in\nNew York Nasty flow, that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen\nBusinessman, middle finger to your fucking business, man\nGreat adventure shit, rollercoasting take a flick of this\nMotion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do\nAlways strive and prosper, Rock what level we gon' take it to?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5fb9bbbba50174ef41a0dd1f68902363.500x500x1.jpg",

mothafuckin' liquor\nFor my mothafuckin' niggas who ain't wit us, keep it trilla'\nMy gold teeth, my french braids, getting throwed since 10th grade\nWealth is in the mind, not the pocket, if that's the case, then I been paid\nHerringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change\nYou bitch made, I'm old school, like gem stars and switchblades\nI spit game, I get paid, a pimp game\nI be, I be that pretty muthafucka, A$AP is just my nickname\n(I'm comin' down when I'm tippin' on them 4's\nCause we shittin' on these, shittin' on these niggas and these hoes)\nCause that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up\nI get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up\nTop of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind\nWe runnin', we runnin', we gunnin', we gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time\nThem bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe\nA weirdo but I'm real though\n\nAll these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em\nNot a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em\nGoing broke is not an option, always on that cash flow\nShe used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low\nFuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke\nA$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow\nI slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up\nThat's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch\nI'm headed to the future, Twelvyy ain't no loser\nMixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster\nI'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up\nI ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up\nI lucked up, I see it as a come up\nI'm on my job man, I see you when the sun's up\nHuh, young niggas run everything\nA$AP to the top and these bitches love everything\n\nGod bless America, my flow is scarier\nStyle wild like my nigga Common after Erykah\nYour bitch, I'm in bed with her, head so good\nMake a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her\nBut I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit\nI be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?\nHoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard\nEast coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise\nI know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers\nFashion killa' word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya\nStill sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in\nKitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in\nNew York Nasty flow, that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen\nBusinessman, middle finger to your fucking business, man\nGreat adventure shit, rollercoasting take a flick of this\nMotion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do\nAlways strive and prosper, Rock what level we gon' take it to?"}}, {"title": "Keep It G", "album": "LIVE.LOVE.A$AP", "year": "2011-10-31", "lyrics": "Fuck

to these bitches, cause I'm sick of all these sisters\nI'm sick and tired of tryna survive\nI'm sick and tired of my environment\nI'm sick and tired of feeling deprived\nI'm one of a kind, when in my climate\nI'm sick and tired of your facade and all of your lying and your diamonds\nBasically, I'm tired of feeling sick and tired\nA$AP, born in money makin' Manhattan\nEvery nigga on my block wanna be a Main Attrakion\nShout my nigga Squadda, shout my nigga Mondre\nIf you disrespect them niggas, then I'm polishin' the nine-trey\nAnd I'm coming to your casa for your madre and your padre\nComprende? Most of these niggas been gay or they strange\nThey say I sound like Andre mixed with Kanye, little bit of Max\nLittle bit of Wiz, little bit of that, little bit of this, get off my dick\n\nI'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket\nI'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it\nTake a hit with me, take a hit with me\nAin't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean\nChilling with my niggas, with my team\nCome and take a sip with me, take a sip with me\n\nOnce again, Mister Back Selling Crack\nIt's an honor keeping real nigga music on the map\nStreet raps, new face, sampled with no credits\nDoubting myself cause I don't think the world can relate\nTo my surprise everyone does, so have faith\nHalf of the other side don't live it they push play\nThe young illest alive, Harlem world to the Bay\nIt feels good waking up to money in the bank\nCause last year it was shoe box and lint\nI only write raps just to give you niggas hints\nEvery verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney\nMy album coming November, that's 20 years of memory\nAnd that's assuming I'mma live that long\nIf I don't, don't cry cause I ain't live that wrong\nJust an artist in a purest form, I live that song\nAn artist in the purest form, I live that song, Bambino\n\nI'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket\nI'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it\nTake a hit with me, take a hit with me\nAin't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean\nChilling with my niggas, with my team\nCome and take a sip with me, take a sip with me\n\nWhy fuss?

stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean\nChilling with my niggas, with my team\nCome and take a sip with me, take a sip with me\n\n\"This go out to all the rappers, this go out to the little darlings\nThe little kids running around in the schoolyards, I love you\nKeep it good, keep it good kids cause you know I love you\nI'mma always love you, forever\""}}, {"title": "Roll One Up",

that shit\nTaz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas\nMaison Martin Margiela, three strap sneakers\nRiding with a leecher, student and a teacher\nIt's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer\nThinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo\nPlay with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo\nPatience is a virtue, life is a handful\nFriends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks\nMe under a lamp post while I got my hands closed\nHaze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled\nYeah I feel Rihanna and I understand Hov\nWhat you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?\nNow I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap\nSome slept on me, other niggas took a nap\nNow I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack\nGave you teaspoons full but instead, you took a cap\nThey say Tyga and Diggy but Rocky been Jiggy\nCurren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home\nCan't really hate when they compare me to Drake\nCould have been J. Cole if I met J-Hov\n\n(Who dat? ASAP) But I'm fly like I never left\nYou's a lie, like fly without the letter F\nIf hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest\nReincarnated through me when she resurrect\nLong hair, Blue jeans, live on U-Stream\nHigh top boots like Pac in a Juice scene\nNo, it ain't a movie, diamonds in by new gleam\nDead tone cause the redbones is my new thing\n\nNigga, I do things, let the coupe sing\nNiggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein\nNiggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne\nFly kicks, my shit, yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang\nI ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas\nI'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest\nAnd your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits\nI only hear the money, save the bullshit for the q-tips\nSwag is the coolest, my bitch is the rudest\nMy jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest\nAnd I get it poppin' on the block like Whoo Kid\nASAP standing on the block like the new kids"}}], "artist": "A$AP Rocky"}
