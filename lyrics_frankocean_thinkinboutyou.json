(How you feel)\nYou know you were my first time, a new feel\nIt won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive\nWe'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white\n\n[Chorus]\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dc39dd864f6a3c818be8ad2ea354dec3.325x325x1.png"}], "artist": "Frank Ocean"}
