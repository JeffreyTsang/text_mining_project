it all falls down\nUh, Chi-Town, stand up!\nOh, when it all, it all falls down\nSouthside, Southside\nWe gon' set this party off right\nI'm tellin' you all, it all falls down\nWestside, Westside\nWe gon' set this party off right\nOh, when it all\n\nMan, I promise, she's so self-conscious\nShe has no idea what she doin' in college\nThat major that she majored in don't make no money\nBut she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny\nNow, tell me that ain't insecurr\nThe concept of school seems so securr\nSophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr\nShe like, \"Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair.\"\n\u2018Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs\nOf new Airs, \u2018cause her baby daddy don't really care\nShe's so precious with the peer pressure\nCouldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis\nShe had hair so long that it looked like weave\nThen she cut it all off, now she look like Eve\nAnd she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe\nSingle black female addicted to retailers, and well\n\nOh, when it all, it all falls down\nAnd when it falls down, who you gon' call now?\nI'm tellin' you all, it all falls down\nC'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down\nOh, when it all\n\nMan, I promise, I'm so self-conscious\nThat's why you always see me with at least one of my watches\nRollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy\nI can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!\nThen I spent four hundred bucks on this\nJust to be like, \"Nigga, you ain't up on this.\"\nAnd I can't even go to the grocery store\nWithout some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team\nIt seem we livin' the American Dream\nBut the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem\nThe prettiest people do the ugliest things\nFor the road to riches and diamond rings\nWe shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us\nWe tryna buy back our 40 acres\nAnd for that paper, look how low we'll stoop\nEven if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe\n\nOh, when it all, it all falls down\nCome on, come on\nI'm tellin' you all, it all falls down\nAnd when it falls down, who you gon' call now?\nOh, when it all, it all falls down\nCome on, come on\nI'm tellin' you all, it all falls down\nAnd when it all falls down\n\nI say, \"Fuck the police,\" that's how I treat 'em\nWe buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom\nWe'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em\nThings we buy to cover up what's inside\n'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth\nThat's why shorty's hollerin', \"Where the ballers at?\"\nDrug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack\nAnd the white man get paid off of all of that\nBut I ain't even gon' act holier than thou\n'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou\nBefore I had a house and I'd do it again\n\u2018Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz\nI want to act ballerific like it's all terrific\nI got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific\nI got a problem with spendin' before I get it\nWe all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it\n\nOh, when it all, it all falls down\nC'mon, c'mon\nAnd when it falls down, who you gon' call now?\nI'm tellin' you all, it all falls down\nC'mon c'mon, and when it falls down\nOh, when it all, it all falls down\nSouthside, Southside\nWe gon' set this party off right\nI'm tellin' you all, it all falls down\nWestside, Westside\nWe gon' set this party off right\nOh when it all, it all falls down\nChi-Town, Chi-Town\nWe gon' show 'em how we get down\nI'm tellin' you all, it all falls down\nNow, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life\nC'mon\nOh when it all, it all falls down\nI'm tellin' you all, it all falls down"}}, {"title": "Spaceship", "album": "The College Dropout",

shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\n\nIf my manager insults me again\nI will be assaulting him\nAfter I fuck the manager up\nThen I'm gonna shorten the register up\nLet's go back, back to the Gap\nLook at my check, wasn't no scratch\nSo if I stole, wasn't my fault\nYeah I stole, never got caught\nThey take me to the back and pat me\nAskin' me about some khakis\nBut let some black people walk in\nI bet you they show off their token blackie\nOh now they love Kanye\nLet's put him all in the front of the store\nSo I'm on break, next to the \"No Smoking\" sign\nWith a blunt in the mall\nTakin' my hits, writing my hits\nWritin' my rhymes, playin' my mind\nThis fuckin' job can't help him\nSo I quit, y'all welcome\nY'all don't know my struggle\nY'all can't match my hustle, you can't catch my hustle\nYou can't fathom my love, dude, lock yourself in a room\nDoing 5 beats a day for 3 summers\nThat's A Different World like Cree Summer's\nI deserve to do these numbers\n\"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!\"\nSo many records in my basement\nI'm just waiting on my spaceship\n\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\n\nAnd I didn't even try to work a job\nRepresent the mob, at the same time\nThirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind\nLost my momma, lost my mind\nLife my love, that's not mine\n\"Why you ain't signed?\" Wasn't my time\nLeave me alone, work for y'all\nHalf of it's yours, half of it's mine\nOnly one to ball, never one to fall\nGot to get mine, got to take mine\nGot a Tec-9, reach my prime\nGot to make these haters respect mine\nIn the mall until 12 when my schedule had said 9\nPutting them pants on shelves, waiting patiently I ask myself\nWhere I want to go, where I want to be\nLife is much more than running in the streets\nHolla at 'Ye, hit me with the beat\nPut me on my feet, sound so sweet\nYes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, staying low key, nope\nHoller at God, \"Man why'd you have to take my folks?\"\nHope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G\nRolly G, police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's\nGot a lot of people counting on me\nAnd I'm just trying to find my peace\nShould've finished school like my niece\nThen I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!\n(Aww, man, this pressure)\n\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\n\nI remember having to take the dollar cab\nComing home real late at night\nStanding on my feet all damn day\nTrying to make this thing right\nAnd having one of my co-workers say \"Yo, you look just like\nThis kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night\"\nWell easy come, easy go, how that saying goes\nNo more broad service, cars, and them TV shows\nI had all that snatched from me\nA&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me\nAnd didn't want to hear a rap from me\nSo naturally actually had to face things factually\nHad to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me\nCause nothing's there, nothing's fair\nI don't want to ever go back there\nSo I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off\n\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\n\nI want to fly, I want to fly\nI said I want my chariot to pick me up\nAnd take me,

spaceship and fly past the sky\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\n\nIf my manager insults me again\nI will be assaulting him\nAfter I fuck the manager up\nThen I'm gonna shorten the register up\nLet's go back, back to the Gap\nLook at my check, wasn't no scratch\nSo if I stole, wasn't my fault\nYeah I stole, never got caught\nThey take me to the back and pat me\nAskin' me about some khakis\nBut let some black people walk in\nI bet you they show off their token blackie\nOh now they love Kanye\nLet's put him all in the front of the store\nSo I'm on break, next to the \"No Smoking\" sign\nWith a blunt in the mall\nTakin' my hits, writing my hits\nWritin' my rhymes, playin' my mind\nThis fuckin' job can't help him\nSo I quit, y'all welcome\nY'all don't know my struggle\nY'all can't match my hustle, you can't catch my hustle\nYou can't fathom my love, dude, lock yourself in a room\nDoing 5 beats a day for 3 summers\nThat's A Different World like Cree Summer's\nI deserve to do these numbers\n\"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!\"\nSo many records in my basement\nI'm just waiting on my spaceship\n\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\n\nAnd I didn't even try to work a job\nRepresent the mob, at the same time\nThirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind\nLost my momma, lost my mind\nLife my love, that's not mine\n\"Why you ain't signed?\" Wasn't my time\nLeave me alone, work for y'all\nHalf of it's yours, half of it's mine\nOnly one to ball, never one to fall\nGot to get mine, got to take mine\nGot a Tec-9, reach my prime\nGot to make these haters respect mine\nIn the mall until 12 when my schedule had said 9\nPutting them pants on shelves, waiting patiently I ask myself\nWhere I want to go, where I want to be\nLife is much more than running in the streets\nHolla at 'Ye, hit me with the beat\nPut me on my feet, sound so sweet\nYes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, staying low key, nope\nHoller at God, \"Man why'd you have to take my folks?\"\nHope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G\nRolly G, police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's\nGot a lot of people counting on me\nAnd I'm just trying to find my peace\nShould've finished school like my niece\nThen I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!\n(Aww, man, this pressure)\n\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\n\nI remember having to take the dollar cab\nComing home real late at night\nStanding on my feet all damn day\nTrying to make this thing right\nAnd having one of my co-workers say \"Yo, you look just like\nThis kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night\"\nWell easy come, easy go, how that saying goes\nNo more broad service, cars, and them TV shows\nI had all that snatched from me\nA&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me\nAnd didn't want to hear a rap from me\nSo naturally actually had to face things factually\nHad to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me\nCause nothing's there, nothing's fair\nI don't want to ever go back there\nSo I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off\n\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a

me)\n\nYou know what the Midwest is? Young and restless\nWhere restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace\nAnd next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus\nSomebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is\nI walk through the valley of the Chi where death is\nTop floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*\nTry to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard\nGetting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method\nThey be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us\nSayin' \"We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast\"\nHuh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?\nWe ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases\nA trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis\nMy mama used to say only Jesus can save us\nWell mama I know I act a fool\nBut I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move\nI hope\n\n(Jesus walk)\nGod show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down\n(Jesus walk with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n(Jesus walk)\nAnd I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs\n(Jesus walk with me)\nI wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long\n(Jesus walk)\nGod show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down\n(Jesus walk with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n(Jesus walk)\nAnd I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs\n(Jesus walk with me)\nI wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long\nSo long, so long\n(Jesus walk with me)\n\nTo the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers\n(Jesus walks for them)\nTo the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah\n(Jesus walks for them)\nNow, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly\nI know He hear me when my feet get weary\n'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct\nWe rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think\nI ain't here to argue about His facial features\nOr here to convert atheists into believers\nI'm just tryna say the way school need teachers\nThe way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus\nSo here go my single, dawg, radio needs this\nThey say you can rap about anything except for Jesus\nThat means guns, sex, lies, videotape\nBut if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?\nWell if this take away from my spins\nWhich'll probably take away from my ends\nThen I hope this take away from my sins\nAnd bring the day that I'm dreamin' about\nNext time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out\n\n(Jesus walk)\nGod show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down\n(Jesus walk with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now"}}, {"title": "Never Let Me Down", "album": "The

I've found, one thing I found\nOh no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up\n\nI get down for my grandfather who took my mama\nMade her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat\nAt the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins\nAnd with that in my blood I was born to be different\nNow niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership\nBut we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership\nThat's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it\nRacism's still alive, they just be concealin' it\nBut I know they don't want me in the damn club\nThey even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club\nI done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed\nSwear I've been baptized 'least three or four times\nBut in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid\nIt's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved\nLike it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves\nNothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away\nSo I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter\nAnd you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up\nAnd I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her\nYou sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up\nBut I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye\nCause look what an accident did to Left Eye\nFirst Aaliyah now Romeo must die\nI know I got angels watching me from the other side\n\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I've found, one thing I found\nOh no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\n\nWe are all here for a reason on a particular path\nYou don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math\nCats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious\nThat's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world\nI'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls\nI'm not just another individual\nMy spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual\nBut I get my hymns from Him\nSo it's not me, it's He that's lyrical\nI'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument\nMy rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes\nFor your soul and your mental\nThat's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into\nYeah I need my loot by rent day\nBut that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte\nI'm trying to get us \"us free\" like Cinque\nI can't stop, that's why I'm hot\nDetermination, dedication, motivation\nI'm talking to you of my many inspirations\nWhen I say I can't let you or self-down\nIf I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff\nAnd if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life\nIn my grip, I would never ever let you down\nAnd when these words are found\nLet it be known that God's penmanship has been signed\nWith a language called love\nThat's why my breath is felt by the deaf\nAnd while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind\nI too dream in color and in rhyme\nSo I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house\nCause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth\nA touch of God reigns out\nTake 'em to church\n\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I found, one thing I found\nOh no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get down\n\nWho else you know been hot this long?\n(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)\nStarted from nothing but he got this strong\n(The Roc is in the building)\nBuilt the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you\nPedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)\nLet you tell it, man, I'm falling\nWell, somebody must have caught him\n'cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them\nNumber one albums, what I got? Like four of them\nMore of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way\nClear the way, I'm here to stay\nY'all can save the chitter chat, this and that\nThis is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced\nWhen I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious\nSix Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'\nYoung the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas\nThey way y'all all follow Jigga\nHov's a living legend and I'll tell you why\nEverybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0bffd93463afe53e7f651f72bedfc78b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kanye West", "raw": {"annotation_count": 49, "api_path": "/songs/1465", "apple_music_id": "1437467882", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/1465/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Originally recorded by Hov for his seventh studio album ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["The Blueprint\u00b2: The Gift & The Curse"]}, ", \u201cNever Let Me Down\u201d finds the track\u2019s inherent hope being interpreted differently by the trio:"]}, "", {"tag": "ul", "children": ["", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Kanye thanks his grandparents for making his mother and him in who they are.

the world\nI'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls\nI'm not just another individual\nMy spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual\nBut I get my hymns from Him\nSo it's not me, it's He that's lyrical\nI'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument\nMy rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes\nFor your soul and your mental\nThat's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into\nYeah I need my loot by rent day\nBut that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte\nI'm trying to get us \"us free\" like Cinque\nI can't stop, that's why I'm hot\nDetermination, dedication, motivation\nI'm talking to you of my many inspirations\nWhen I say I can't let you or self-down\nIf I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff\nAnd if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life\nIn my grip, I would never ever let you down\nAnd when these words are found\nLet it be known that God's penmanship has been signed\nWith a language called love\nThat's why my breath is felt by the deaf\nAnd while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind\nI too dream in color and in rhyme\nSo I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house\nCause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth\nA touch of God reigns out\nTake 'em to church\n\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I found, one thing I found\nOh no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get down\n\nWho else you know been hot this long?\n(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)\nStarted from nothing but he got this strong\n(The Roc is in the building)\nBuilt the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you\nPedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)\nLet you tell it, man, I'm falling\nWell, somebody must have caught him\n'cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them\nNumber one albums, what I got?

tell you to put down your hands\n(Keep 'em high)\nAnd if you're losin' your high then smoke again\n(Keep 'em high)\n\nN-n-n-now, my flow\nIs in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics\nI can't call it, I got the swerve like alcohol-ics\nMy freshman year I was going through hella problems\n'Til I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college\nMy teacher said I'se a loser, I told her \"Why don't you kill me?\"\nI give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna fol-low my heart\nAnd if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks\nYou ain't gotta guess who's back, you see\nI'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful\nBut this bastard's flow will bash your skull\nAnd I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro'\nAnd I don't, usually smoke, but pass the 'dro\nAnd I won't, give you that money that you askin' for\nWhy you think me and Dame cool? We assholes\nThat's why we hear your music in fast forward\n'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'\n\nN-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands\n(Get 'em high)\nAll the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man\n(Get 'em high)\nNow I ain't never tell you to put down your hands\n(Keep 'em high)\nAnd if you're losin' yo' high, then smoke again\n(Keep 'em high)\n\n(\"You've got mail!\") N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this\nE-mailing me at 11:26?\nTelling me that she 36-26, plus double-d\nYou know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly\nAt NYU but she hail from Kansas\nRight now she just lampin', chillin' on campus\nSent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice\nWho said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis\nW-H-I-T, it's getting late mami\nYour screen saver say tweet, so you got to \"call me\"\nAnd bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli\n(You mean Talib? Lyrics sticks to your rib)\nI mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)\nI mean (You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?)\nYo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line\nShe gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines\nThen maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time\nAnd get her high! Owww!\n\nYeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes\nBut never-mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out\nAnd my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out\nWell okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm\nAyo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?\nAnd sister's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior\nAlways got something to say like a okay playa hater\nAnyways, I don't usually fuck with the Internet\nOr chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette\nYou really fuckin' that much or tryna get off cigarettes? (Keep 'em high)\nIf she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet\nNow I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate\nI got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it, yeah\n\nYo, yo\nGet 'em high like noon or the moon\nOr a room filled with smoke, a hype-filled with dope\nY'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune\nBut I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes\nReal rappers is hard to find, like a remote\nControl rap is out of\nUsed to, but still got love\nThat's why I abuse you who are not thugs\nRock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood\nShould have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor\nI stole on live-er niggas than you\nYou's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you\nHow could I ever let your words affect me?\nThey say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me\nMarsha's too sexy to even make songs like these\nThat's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys\nToo many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is popular\nTwelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a\nAlbum, how come you the hot garbage of\nThe year? It's clear your image is looped up\nLabel got you souped up, tellin' you you sick\nWhen you a dick with a loose nut\nVideo hard to watch like Medusa\nEven your club record need a booster, chimped up\nWith a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-\nRed across your head, I'm bred king like Simba\nBolder than Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper\nJust a emcee with a temper\nYou dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way\nSo when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye\nSpittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'\nGot your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then\n\nN-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands\n(Get 'em high, yeah)\nAll the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man\n(Get 'em high, mm-mm, uh-uh)\nNow I ain't never tell you to put down your hands\n(Keep 'em high, keep 'em high, keep 'em high, uh-uh)\nAnd if you're losin' your high then smoke again\n(Keep 'em high)"}}, {"title": "Workout Plan", "album": "The College Dropout", "year":

(probably)\nBut is it cool to rap about gold\nIf I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)\nFirst nigga with a Benz and a backpack\nIce chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack\nAlways said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant\nBut now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again\nAnd it's still about the Benjamins\nBig faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms\nStrippers named Cinnamon, more chips than Pentium\n\"What'cha gon' buy next?\" Whatever new trend it is\nI'm tryin' to spend my stacks, and I'm so broke\nI look back like \"Damn, was I on crack?\"\nI mean, twelve platinum chains, was I on that?\nWhat the hell was wrong with me dog?\nSing along with me y'all\n\nYeah, breathe in, breathe out\nIf ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\nPush a big truck, pull ya keys out\nGirls go wild and pull ya D's out\nBreathe in, breathe out\nLet them hoes fight, pull her weave out\nIf a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\nWhen I pull the piece out niggas like \"Peace out!\"\n\nNow even though I went to college\nAnd dropped out of school quick\nI always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick\nLadies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this\nAnd givin' head is like a whale that's usin' a toothpick\nWell, I'm in the club for a limited time\nAct now and get some action for a $free.99\nLater on, I might charge for m\u00e9nage\nHeard her man was the boss of the floss\nBut she still want to toss me the drawers\nAnd it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy\nCuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club\nAnd I'm still actin' calm den-a-muhh, she asked\n\"Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?\"\nWhile we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man\nBaby, I fully understand, let me help you with a plan\nWhile he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga\nGive me some head, that'll really piss him off\n\nYeah, breathe in, breathe out\nIf ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\nPush a big truck, pull ya keys out\nGirls go wild and pull ya D's out\nBreathe in, breathe out\nLet them hoes fight, pull her weave out\nIf a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out\nWhen I pull the piece out niggas like \"Peace out!\"\n\nI blow past low-class niggas with no cash\nIn the four dash six, bitch you can go ask\nSo when I go fast popo just laugh\nRight until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash\nWhatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst\nWhatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon\nPullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand\nSo I guess them GSes was ambidextrous\nCoulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages\n\"K I need a free hand mammogram\nI got weed, drink, and a Handicam\nAll of which is legal in Amsterdam\"\nSo say my name like Candyman\nAnd I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman\nBut if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave\nYou can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe\n\nYeah, breathe in, breathe out\nIf ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out\nPush a big truck, pull ya keys out\nGirls go wild and pull ya D's out\nBreathe in, breathe out\nLet them hoes fight, pull her weave out\nIf a nigga act up, pull a

you, I'd gladly risk it all\nThrough the fire, through whatever, come what may\nFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way\nRight down to the wire, even through the fire\n\nI spit it through the wire, man\nThere's too much stuff on my heart right now, man\nI'd gladly risk it all right now\nIt's a life-or-death situation, man\nY'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man\nIt's your boy, Kanye to the\u2026\nChi-Town, what's goin' on?\n\nI drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert\nSomebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp\nThat right there could drive a sane man berserk\nNot to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk\nHow do you console my mom or give her light support\nTellin' her her son's on life support?\nAnd just imagine how my girl feel\nOn the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till\nShe was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine\nShe a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign\nNo use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed\nTryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines\nIn the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died\nThe doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man\nStory on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band\nI swear, this right here, history in the makin', man\n\nThrough the fire, to the limit, to the wall\nFor a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all\nThrough the fire, through whatever, come what may\nFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way\nRight down to the wire, even through the fire\n\nI really apologize for everything right now\nIf it's unclear at all, man\nThey got my mouth wired shut\nFor like\u2026 I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks\nY'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw\nI looked in the mirror\nAnd half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man\nI couldn't believe it\nBut I'm still here for y'all right now, man\nThis what I got to say right here, dawg\nYeah, turn me up, yeah, uh\n\nWhat if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal\nOn the hottest rap label around?\nBut he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds\nIt was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?\nAnd he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory\nAnd what we need to do in the game\nGood dude, bad night, right place, wrong time\nIn the blink of a eye, his whole life changed\nIf you could feel how my face felt\nYou would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)\nThank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt\nI swear to God, driver two wanna sue\nI got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe\nMy dawgs couldn't tell if I\u2026\nI looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised\nThere's been an accident like GEICO\nThey thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael\nI must got a angel, \u2018cause look how death missed his ass\nUnbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?\nLook back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past\nToys \"R\" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash\nAnd I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid\nSwear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did\nBut I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph\nMake music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire\n\nThrough the fire, to the limit, to the wall\nFor a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all\nThrough the fire, through whatever, come what may\nFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way\nRight down to the wire, even through the fire\n\nY'know what I'm sayin'?\nWhen the doctor told me I had, um\nThat I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said\n\"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?\"\n\"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!\"\nYou can't be serious, man", "image":

fire, to the limit, to the wall\nFor a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all\nThrough the fire, through whatever, come what may\nFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way\nRight down to the wire, even through the fire\n\nI spit it through the wire, man\nThere's too much stuff on my heart right now, man\nI'd gladly risk it all right now\nIt's a life-or-death situation, man\nY'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man\nIt's your boy, Kanye to the\u2026\nChi-Town, what's goin' on?\n\nI drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert\nSomebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp\nThat right there could drive a sane man berserk\nNot to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk\nHow do you console my mom or give her light support\nTellin' her her son's on life support?\nAnd just imagine how my girl feel\nOn the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till\nShe was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine\nShe a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign\nNo use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed\nTryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines\nIn the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died\nThe doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man\nStory on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band\nI swear, this right here, history in the makin', man\n\nThrough the fire, to the limit, to the wall\nFor a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all\nThrough the fire, through whatever, come what may\nFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way\nRight down to the wire, even through the fire\n\nI really apologize for everything right now\nIf it's unclear at all, man\nThey got my mouth wired shut\nFor like\u2026 I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks\nY'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw\nI looked in the mirror\nAnd half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man\nI couldn't believe it\nBut I'm still here for y'all right now, man\nThis what I got to say right here, dawg\nYeah, turn me up, yeah, uh\n\nWhat if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal\nOn the hottest rap label around?\nBut he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds\nIt was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?\nAnd he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory\nAnd what we need to do in the game\nGood dude, bad night, right place, wrong time\nIn the blink of a eye, his whole life changed\nIf you could feel how my face felt\nYou would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)\nThank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt\nI swear to God, driver two wanna sue\nI got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe\nMy dawgs couldn't tell if I\u2026\nI looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised\nThere's been an accident like GEICO\nThey thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael\nI must got a angel, \u2018cause look how death missed his ass\nUnbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?\nLook back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past\nToys \"R\" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash\nAnd I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid\nSwear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did\nBut I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph\nMake music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire\n\nThrough the fire, to the limit, to the wall\nFor a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all\nThrough the fire, through whatever, come what may\nFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way\nRight down to the wire, even through the fire\n\nY'know what I'm sayin'?\nWhen the doctor told me I had, um\nThat I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said\n\"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?\"\n\"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!\"\nYou can't

I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID.

I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't be Life.\"\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n\nAnd he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0bffd93463afe53e7f651f72bedfc78b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kanye West", "raw": {"annotation_count": 75, "api_path": "/songs/910", "apple_music_id": "1437467907", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/910/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["On ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["The College Dropout"]}, "\u2019s final track (hence the title), Kanye West tells his story from being just a producer to the Yeezy we all know and love."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["The track was originally produced by fellow rapper/producer ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Evidence", "rel": "noopener"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/1022"}, "children": ["Evidence"]}, " from the West Coast rap group ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Dilated-peoples", "rel": "noopener"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/1091"}, "children": ["Dilated Peoples"]}, ".

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\n\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't be Life.\"\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n\nAnd he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you..."}}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
