up in a bed between my mom and aunt\nPlaying with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut\nMy dad works nights, putting on a stone face\nHe's saving up so we can get our own place\nIn the projects, man that sounds fancy to me\nThey called me \"fat nose,\" my mom say, \"You handsome to me\"\nMrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced\nBut he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants\nAnd I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out\nThey talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about\nCause hood shit and black shit is super different\nSo I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition\nMom and dad wouldn't listen\nThey left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that\nAll their friends in NY deal crack\nIt's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em\nBut when you leave the hood\nThey think that you look down on 'em\nThe truth is we still struggle on a different plane\n7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same\nFacebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit\nBut all they get now is, \"Can your son read this script?\"\n\nThere's a world we can visit if we go outside\nOutside, outside\u2014we can follow the road\nThere's a world we can visit if we go outside\nOutside, outside\u2014no one knows\nThere's a world we can visit if we go outside\nOutside, outside\u2014we can follow the road\nThere's a world we can visit if we go outside\nOutside, outside\u2014no one knows\n\nYeah, Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's\nGun pulled in her face, she still made dinner\n\u201cDonald watch the meter so they don\u2019t turn the lights off\"\nWorkin' two jobs so I can get into that white school\nAnd I hate it there\nThey all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair\nAnd my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook\nDrug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book\nHe\u2019s supposed to pay \u2018em back\nHe owe 'em money but his bank account is zero\nSo my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads\nUnder the

heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\n\nI know what your boy like\nSkinny tie and a cuff type\nHe go and make breakfast\nYou walk around naked\nI might just text you\nTurn your phone over, when it's all over\nNo settling down, my text go to your screen\nYou know better than that\nI come around when you least expect me\nI'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty\nYou thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me\nI need to be alone like the way you left me\nYou start calling, you start crying\nI come over, I'm inside you\nI can't find you, the girl that I once had\nBut the sex that we have isn't half bad\nText say that \"It's not fair\"\nThat's code for \"He's not here\"\nAnd I'ma flirt with this new girl\nAnd I'ma call if it don't work\nSo we fuck 'til we come to conclusions\nAll the things that we thought we were losing\nI'm a ghost and you know this\nThat's why we broke up in the first place\n'Cause\n\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\n\nIt's late night Thursday\nI know that you heard me\nBut you don't want the same thing\nWell two can play that game\nSo I'm chilling with my girlfriend\nBut she not my real girlfriend\nShe got a key to my place but\nShe's not my real girlfriend\nStupid, so dummy\nSay the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'\nI'm paranoid that these girls want something from me\nAnd it's hard to make a dime go 100\nAnd my dude freakin' out over a worse fate\nShe on time, but she late for they first date\nCause he went and tried out a new condom\nSlipped off in a threesome, good problems?\nRight? Wrong\nAskin' him if she wanna play games\nWith the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you\nI miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through\n69 is the only dinner for two\nI was wrong, but would you have listened to you?\nUh, you were crazy\nI got a heart, but the artichoke\nIs the only thing girls want when you in that smoke\nAnd light\n\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\n\nSo we're done? This the real shit?\nWe used to hold hands like field trips\nI'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick\nI read his post on your wall and I feel sick\nHe ain't cool, he ball and all that\nBut he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps\nYou couldn't wait to date\nI'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate\nI give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate\nYou know that I\u2019m the best when I\u2019m a-fake-tionate\nI'm the best that you had, face it\nJ and Keyshia are related: racist\nI give you money, then you burn me, then you made off\nShe ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off\nI know he wondering, \"What the fuck you hiding?\"\nThat we dated like raps about Bin Laden\nAyo, fuck this\nAre we dating? Are we fucking?\nAre we best friends? Are we something? In between that?\nI wish we never fucked, and I mean that\n(But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 awesome)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/78236fad04ed869070b0d50a1b6a02fa.600x602x1.jpg", "artist": "Childish Gambino", "raw": {"annotation_count": 14, "api_path": "/songs/58043", "apple_music_id": "1451001461", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/58043/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cHeartbeat\u201d is a song about The One, and not being able to have or be with her.

heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\n\nI know what your boy like\nSkinny tie and a cuff type\nHe go and make breakfast\nYou walk around naked\nI might just text you\nTurn your phone over, when it's all over\nNo settling down, my text go to your screen\nYou know better than that\nI come around when you least expect me\nI'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty\nYou thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me\nI need to be alone like the way you left me\nYou start calling, you start crying\nI come over, I'm inside you\nI can't find you, the girl that I once had\nBut the sex that we have isn't half bad\nText say that \"It's not fair\"\nThat's code for \"He's not here\"\nAnd I'ma flirt with this new girl\nAnd I'ma call if it don't work\nSo we fuck 'til we come to conclusions\nAll the things that we thought we were losing\nI'm a ghost and you know this\nThat's why we broke up in the first place\n'Cause\n\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\n\nIt's late night Thursday\nI know that you heard me\nBut you don't want the same thing\nWell two can play that game\nSo I'm chilling with my girlfriend\nBut she not my real girlfriend\nShe got a key to my place but\nShe's not my real girlfriend\nStupid, so dummy\nSay the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'\nI'm paranoid that these girls want something from me\nAnd it's hard to make a dime go 100\nAnd my dude freakin' out over a worse fate\nShe on time, but she late for they first date\nCause he went and tried out a new condom\nSlipped off in a threesome, good problems?\nRight? Wrong\nAskin' him if she wanna play games\nWith the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you\nI miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through\n69 is the only dinner for two\nI was wrong, but would you have listened to you?\nUh, you were crazy\nI got a heart, but the artichoke\nIs the only thing girls want when you in that smoke\nAnd light\n\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\n\nSo we're done? This the real shit?\nWe used to hold hands like field trips\nI'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick\nI read his post on your wall and I feel sick\nHe ain't cool, he ball and all that\nBut he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps\nYou couldn't wait to date\nI'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate\nI give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate\nYou know that I\u2019m the best when I\u2019m a-fake-tionate\nI'm the best that you had, face it\nJ and Keyshia are related: racist\nI give you money, then you burn me, then you made off\nShe ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off\nI know he wondering, \"What the fuck you hiding?\"\nThat we dated like raps about Bin Laden\nAyo, fuck this\nAre we dating? Are we fucking?\nAre we best friends? Are we something? In between that?\nI wish we never fucked, and I mean that\n(But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 awesome)"}}, {"title": "Backpackers", "album": "Camp", "year": "2011-11-15", "lyrics": "Alright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk-About-His-Dick-Again\nNerdy-ass black kid, whatever, man, I'm sick of him\nThat well-spoken token, who ain't been heard\nThe only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word\nI buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card\nNow I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out\nI got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect\nSomething crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech\nShe too fine, I do dimes\nIf not that, I'm walking out with two fives\nChange my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet\nBlack male in short shorts, I'm double suspect\nBallin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay\nMaybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say\nI'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie\nBut I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me\nFuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish\nBut people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished\nLike, \"What is this nigga doin?

token, who ain't been heard\nThe only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word\nI buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card\nNow I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out\nI got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect\nSomething crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech\nShe too fine, I do dimes\nIf not that, I'm walking out with two fives\nChange my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet\nBlack male in short shorts, I'm double suspect\nBallin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay\nMaybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say\nI'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie\nBut I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me\nFuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish\nBut people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished\nLike, \"What is this nigga doin? Rap is for real blacks\nI hate that fucking faggot, man, he think that we feel that\"\nOr \"I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown\nSo I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about\"\nYou better shut your mouth before I fuck it\nYou really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's?

saw through me\n\"Are you serious? What is this?\"\nTook the jacket off third period, ellipsis\nListening to \"Sky Is the Limit\" on my Walkman\nThinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can\nDope-boy swag, I always wanted that\nBut my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe\nBut no love for the son of a commuter who was a radio head\nAnd okay at them computers at the post office\nIt's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins\nAll my people need throat lozenge\nMy fear is dead, ambition drove the hearse\nBut niggas got me feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church\nCulture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough\nWe all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?\nThe black experience is black and serious\nCause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us\nWhite kids get to wear whatever hat they want\nWhen it comes to black kids one size fits all\n\nOoh, I want it, yeah\nWhenever you need my hand\nI'll hold you down, oh\nOoh, you want it, yeah\nWhy in the fuck these niggas\nTryin' to hold me down, oh\nYeah, uh\nWhy in the fuck these niggas\nTry and hold me down, ohh\n\nWe the baddest nigga\nWe the baddest nigga, you hear me?\nWe the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga\nWe the baddest nigga, we the baddest\nWe the baddest nigga, we the baddest\n\nThe reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's\nThe same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls\nThey only see you how they wanna see you\n'Til you make them see you in some other way\nI'm trippin' off the other day\n'Cause God knows what these white kids say and do\nYou're not not racist 'cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue\nSubtle racism, it's hard to pin it\n'Cause you'd only understand if you were me for just a minute\nThis one kid said somethin' that was really bad\nHe said I wasn't really black because I had a dad\nI think that's kinda sad\nMostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that\nIf you're a father, you should stick around if you could\n'Cause even if you're bad at it, you could Tiger Woods or MJ\nWe warriors, we all need senseis\nChange everything that we've done so far\nI don't mean makin' B.E.T.

That\u2019s you\nAnd we\u2019re still at camp as long as we\u2019re on the bus\nAnd not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us\nWe\u2019re still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles\nI like you and you like me and I more-than-like you\nBut I don\u2019t know if you do or don\u2019t more-than-like me\nYou\u2019ve never said, so I haven\u2019t been saying anything all summer\nContent to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me\nAnd choosing to do so again the next day and so on\nA girl who\u2019s smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh\nIs willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh\nBut who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be\nA girl who reads books that no one\u2019s assigned to her\nWhose curly brown hair has a line running through it\nFrom where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet\nBack in the real world we don\u2019t go to the same school\nAnd unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood\nWe won\u2019t go to the same high school\nSo, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something\nAnd it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something\nThe sun\u2019s gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep\nWe\u2019re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop\nThat looks like a kid we know\nAnd then I\u2019m like, \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d\nAnd all of a sudden I\u2019m telling you\nAnd I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming\nAnd your face is there and gone and there and gone\nAs we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway\nAnd there\u2019s no expression on it\nAnd I think just after a point I\u2019m just talking to lengthen the time\nWhere we live in a world where you haven\u2019t said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d yet\nAnd regrettably I end up using the word \u201cdestiny\u201d\nI don\u2019t remember in what context. Doesn\u2019t really matter\nBefore long I\u2019m out of stuff to say and you smile and say, \u201cokay\u201d\nI don\u2019t know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive\nAnd I would leave in order not to spoil the moment\nBut there\u2019s nowhere to go because we\u2019re on a bus\nSo I pretend like I\u2019m asleep and before long, I really am\nI wake up, the bus isn\u2019t moving anymore\nThe domed lights that line the center aisle are all on\nI turn and you\u2019re not there\nThen again a lot of kids aren\u2019t in their seats anymore\nWe\u2019re parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church\nThe bus is half empty. You might be in your dad\u2019s car by now\nYour bags and things piled high in the trunk\nThe girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time\nDisembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus\nJust as one of them reaches my row\nIt used to be our row, on our way off\nIt\u2019s Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week\nAfter throwing rocks at my head\nAdolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise\nShe stops and looks down at me\nAnd her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can\u2019t really see her face\nBut I can see her smile. And she says one word: \u201cdestiny\u201d\nThen her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh\nAnd then she turns and leads them off the bus\nI didn\u2019t know you were friends with them\nI find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over\nSo is summer, even though there\u2019s two weeks until school starts\nThis isn\u2019t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad\nThis is a story about how I learned something and I\u2019m not saying this thing is true or not\nI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s what I learned\nI told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody\nSo I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always\nEverybody can\u2019t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them\nBut this means there isn\u2019t a place in my life for you or someone like you\nIs it sad? Sure. But it\u2019s a sadness I chose\nI wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy\nAnd got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit\nBut that\u2019s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus\nI still haven\u2019t", "image": "https://images.genius.com/00196af444633a4108e6dc544358985e.630x630x1.jpg", "artist": "Childish Gambino", "raw": {"annotation_count": 26, "api_path": "/songs/58049", "apple_music_id": "1451001720", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/58049/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["The final track from ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Camp"]}]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["The end is a sick, Spoken Word piece telling a story that really ties together the album\u2019s summer camp theme"]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["Outro written by fellow Derrick Comedy member and ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Dc-pierson", "rel": "noopener"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/2081"}, "children": ["rapper"]}, " D.C.

power\nThat power\nOh, oh oh\n\nSo CG, but a nigga stay real though\nI'm fly, I'm ill, I'm runnin' shit\n3-points, field goal\nRappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell\nCause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian, bail\nYeah, they starin' at me jealous 'cause I do shows bigger\nBut your looks don't help like an old gold digger\nUncool, but lyrically I'm a stone cold killer\nSo it's 400 blows to these Truffaut niggas\nYeah, now that's the line of the century\nNiggas missed it, too busy, they lyin' 'bout penitentiary\nMan, you ain't been there, nigga you been scared\nAnd I'm still livin' single like Synclaire\nLovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate\nWhen I wasn\u2019t white enough to use your pool when I was eight\nStone Mountain, you raised me well\nI\u2019m stared at by Confederates, but hard as hell\nTight jeans, penny loafers, but I still drink a fo' dime\nStaying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides\nI\u2019m just a kid who blowin' up with my father\u2019s name\nAnd every black \"You're not black enough\"\nIs a white \"you're all the same\"\nMm Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes\n'Cause it's Oreos, Twinkies, coconuts, delicious\nHow many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?\nI said, \"I want a full house\"\nThey said, \"You got it, dude\"\n\nAll these haters, see you later\nAll that I could do, but you don't even feel me though (Brra)\nI know you know I know you got that power\nThat power\nOh, oh oh\n\nHolla, holla, holla, holla at your boy\nLike your dad when he's pissed off\nGot flow, I could make a cripple crip walk\nNiggas' breath stank, all they do is shit talk\nPeople want a real man, I made 'em wait this long\nMaybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'\nAnd save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins\nHow'd it happen? Honesty did it\nSee all of my competition at the bodies exhibit\nYeah, I bodied the limits and I deaded them fakers\nMotherfuck if you hate it, cremated them haters\nSo, my studio be a funeral\nYeah, this is our year, oh you didn't know?\nUh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den\nMan I'm hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead\nOn stage wit' my family in front of me\nI am what I am: everything I wanna be\n\nAll these haters, see you later\nAll that I could do, but you don't even feel me though\nI know you know I know you got that power\nThat power\nOh, oh oh\n\nThis is on a bus back from camp\nI\u2019m thirteen and so are you\nBefore I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes\nI hadn\u2019t met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble\nIt turned out it would be me and just one girl. That\u2019s you\nAnd we\u2019re still at camp as long as we\u2019re on the bus\nAnd not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us\nWe\u2019re still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles\nI like you and you like me and I more-than-like you\nBut I don\u2019t know if you do or don\u2019t more-than-like me\nYou\u2019ve never said, so I haven\u2019t been saying anything all summer\nContent to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me\nAnd choosing to do so again the next day and so on\nA girl who\u2019s smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh\nIs willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh\nBut who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be\nA girl who reads books that no one\u2019s assigned to her\nWhose curly brown hair has a line running through it\nFrom where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet\nBack in the real world we don\u2019t go to the same school\nAnd unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood\nWe won\u2019t go to the same high school\nSo, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something\nAnd it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something\nThe sun\u2019s gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep\nWe\u2019re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop\nThat looks like a kid we know\nAnd then I\u2019m like, \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d\nAnd all of a sudden I\u2019m telling you\nAnd I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming\nAnd your face is there and gone and there and gone\nAs we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway\nAnd there\u2019s no expression on it\nAnd I think just after a point I\u2019m just talking to lengthen the time\nWhere we live in a world where you haven\u2019t said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d yet\nAnd regrettably I end up using the word \u201cdestiny\u201d\nI don\u2019t remember in what context. Doesn\u2019t really matter\nBefore long I\u2019m out of stuff to say and you smile and say, \u201cokay\u201d\nI don\u2019t know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive\nAnd I would leave in order not to spoil the moment\nBut there\u2019s nowhere to go because we\u2019re on a bus\nSo I pretend like I\u2019m asleep and before long, I really am\nI wake up, the bus isn\u2019t moving anymore\nThe domed lights that line the center aisle are all on\nI turn and you\u2019re not there\nThen again a lot of kids aren\u2019t in their seats anymore\nWe\u2019re parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church\nThe bus is half empty. You might be in your dad\u2019s car by now\nYour bags and things piled high in the trunk\nThe girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time\nDisembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus\nJust as one of them reaches my row\nIt used to be our row, on our way off\nIt\u2019s Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week\nAfter throwing rocks at my head\nAdolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise\nShe stops and looks down at me\nAnd her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can\u2019t really see her face\nBut I can see her smile. And she says one word: \u201cdestiny\u201d\nThen her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh\nAnd then she turns and leads them off the bus\nI didn\u2019t know you were friends with them\nI find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over\nSo is summer, even though there\u2019s two weeks until school starts\nThis isn\u2019t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad\nThis is a story about how I learned something and I\u2019m not saying this thing is true or not\nI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s what I learned\nI told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody\nSo I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always\nEverybody can\u2019t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them\nBut this means there isn\u2019t a place in my life for you or someone like you\nIs it sad? Sure. But it\u2019s a sadness I chose\nI wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy\nAnd got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit\nBut that\u2019s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus\nI still haven\u2019t"}}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
