Rosecrans, ya bitch\n\nSmokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah\nDrank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah\nReally I'm a sober soul\nBut I'm with the homies right now\nAnd we ain't askin' for no favors\nRush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah\nReally, I'm a peacemaker\nBut I'm with the homies right now\nAnd Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)\nOne day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)\nOne day it's gon' burn you out, out, out\nOne day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)\nOne day it's gon' burn you\nBut I'm with the homies right now\n\n\nMe and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota\nA quarter tank of gas, one pistol and orange soda\nJanky stash box when the federales'll roll up\nBasketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor\nWe on the mission for bad bitches and trouble\nI hope the universe love you today\n'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away\nA flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate\nIf it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted\nSpeakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent\nThe windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it\nHotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses\nOf the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls\nAnd asked them what they workin' with\nLook at me, I got the blunt in my mouth\nUsually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies\n\nYeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red\nCome through and bust ya head, nigga!\nMe and the homies\nSag all the way to the liquor store\nWhere my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more\nMe and the homies\nI ride for my mothafuckin' niggas\nHop out, do my stuff, then hop back in\nMe and the homies\nMatter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka\nAnd be like \"doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!\u201d\n\nIt's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'\nAir conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'\nHungry for anything unhealthy\nAnd if nutrition can help me\nI'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'\nWe speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester\nYou know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses\nGood Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there\n'Cause every time we down there\nWe pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards\nBougie bitches with no extensions\nHood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination\nBefore we sparked a conversation\nWe seen three niggas in colors we didn't like\nThen started interrogatin'\nI never was a gangbanger, I mean\nI never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it\nRush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it\nThat's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent\nUntil I'm with the homies\n\n(Just ridin', just ridin')\nMe and the homies\n(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)\nMe and the homies\n(Trippin', really trippin')\nMe and the homies\n(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')\n\nBraggin' 'bout the episode we just had\nA shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad\nI'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma\nConsequences from evil will make your past haunt ya\nWe tryna conquer the city with disobedience\nQuick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in\nBut Jeezy still playin'\nAnd our attitude is still \"nigga, what is you sayin'?\"\nPull in front of the house\nThat we been campin' out for like two months\nThe sun is goin' down as we take whatever we

high\nTell 'em dim the lights down right now\nPut me in the mood\nI'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go\n\nI recognize your fragrance\nHold up, you ain't never gotta say shit\nUh, and I know your taste is\nA little bit, hmm, high maintenance\nUh, everybody else basic\nYou live life on an everyday basis\nWith poetic justice, poetic justice\nIf I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room\nWould you trust it?\nI mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when\nYou're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen\nBetter yet, where your friends and 'em?\nI really wanna know you all\nI really wanna show you off\nFuck that, pour up plenty of champagne\nCold nights when you curse this name\nYou called up your girlfriends\nAnd y'all curled in that little bitty Range\nI heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party\nNigga, don't approach her with that Atari\nNigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry\nThey say conversation rule a nation, I can tell\nBut I could never right my wrongs\n'Less I write it down for real, P.S\n\nYou can get it, you can get it\nYou can get it, you can get it\nAnd I know just, know just, know just\nKnow just, know just what you want\nPoetic justice, put it in a song, alright\nYou can get it, you can get it\nYou can get it, you can get it\nAnd I know just, know just, know just\nKnow just, know just what you want\nPoetic justice, put it in a song, alright\n\nI really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience\nWith all these seductive photographs\nAnd all these one-off vacations you've been takin'\nClearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense\nYoung East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man\nI was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane\nTake you and your momma to the motherland\nI could do it, maybe one day\nWhen you figure out you're gonna need someone\nWhen you figure out it's alright here in the city\nAnd you don't run from where we come from\nThat sound like poetic justice, poetic justice\nYou were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted\nI mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex\nYour natural hair and your soft skin\nAnd your big ass in that sundress, ooh\nGood God, what you doin' that walk for?\nWhen I see that thing move\nI just wish we would fight less and we would talk more\nThey say communication save relations, I can tell\nBut I can never right my wrongs\nUnless I write 'em down for real, P.S\n\nYou can get it, you can get it\nYou can get it, you can get it\nAnd I know just, know just, know just\nKnow just, know just what you want\nPoetic justice, put it in a song, alright\nYou can get it, you can get it\nYou can get it, you can get it\nAnd I know just, know just, know just\nKnow just, know just what you want\nPoetic justice, put it in a song, alright\n\nEvery time I write these words they become a taboo\nMakin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true\nLivin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof\nI'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice\nIf I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room\nWould you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this\nLove is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror\nLove is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe\nCall me crazy, we can both be insane\nA fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain\nI mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb\nAnd I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve\nI want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it\nUh-huh, that's your heartbeat\nIt either caught me or it called me, uh-huh\nRead slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines\nSincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S\n\nYou can get it, you can get it\nYou can get it, you can get it\nAnd I know just, know just, know just\nKnow just, know just what you want\nPoetic justice, put it in a song\n\n\"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie\nWhere is you from? Or it is a problem.\"\n\"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?\"\n\"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for\nIf he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry.\"\n\"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?\nI'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?\nYou gon' tell me where you from, okay?\nOr where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?\"\n\"Enough with all this talkin'.\"\n\"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie!

these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals\nOf a prisoner on his way\nTrapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray\nTrack attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away\nI should ask a choir: \"What do you require\nTo sing a song that acquire me to have faith?\"\nAs the record spin I should pray\nFor the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey\nI got ate alive yesterday\nI got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'\nMe jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe\nBut what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue\nAnd you understand that I ain't\nBut know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble\nAnd live in the street with rank\nNo better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study\nAnd called his homies because he had said he noticed my face\nFrom a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang\nStep on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks\nI don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect\nThe good kid, m.A.A.d city\n\nMass hallucination, baby\nIll education, baby\nWant to reconnect with your elations?\nThis is your station, baby\n\nAll I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight\nFindin' me by myself, promise me you can help\nIn all honesty I got time to be copacetic until\nYou had finally made decision to hold me against my will\nIt was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still\nI can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill\nEvery time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill\nAll my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere\nAs a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear\nBut what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue\nFlash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof\nAnd you ask: \"Lift up your shirt,\" because you wonder if a tattoo\nOf affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through\nGang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile\nI heard 'em chatter: \"He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down\nStep on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest\nHe don't mind, he know we'll never respect\nThe good kid, m.A.A.d. city.\"\n\nMass hallucination, baby\nIll education, baby\nWant to reconnect with your elations?\nThis is your station, baby\n\nAll I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms\nGrown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane\nSociety? It's entirely stressful upon my brain\nYou hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change\nWhen violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain\nThe silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms\nSome grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose\nThe streets sure to release the worst side of my best\nDon't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city\n\nMass hallucination, baby\nIll education, baby\nWant to reconnect with your elations?\nThis is your station, baby"}}, {"title": "\u200bm.A.A.d city", "album": "good kid, m.A.A.d city (Deluxe Version)", "year": "2012-10-22", "lyrics": "If Pirus and Crips all got along\nThey'd probably gun me down by the end of this song\nSeem like the whole city go against me\nEvery time I'm in the street, I hear\u2014\nYAWK!

grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles\nGranddaddy had the golden flask\nBackstroke every day in Chicago\nSome people like the way it feels\nSome people wanna kill their sorrows\nSome people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem\nI was in a dark room, loud tunes\nLookin' to make a vow soon\nThat I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood\nChangin' by the minute and the record on repeat\nTook a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me\n\nNigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?\nI'ma show you how to turn it up a notch\nFirst you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it\nPool full of liquor, then you dive in it\nI wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock\nAll the girls wanna play Baywatch\nI got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it\nPool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it\n\nPour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)\nSit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)\nPass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)\nFaded (Drank), faded (Drank)\n\nOkay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick\nI am your conscience, if you do not hear me\nThen you will be history, Kendrick\nI know that you're nauseous right now\nAnd I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick\nIf I take another one down\nI'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit\nI think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes\nI see the feelin', the freedom is granted\nAs soon as the damage of vodka arrived\nThis how you capitalize, this is parental advice\nThen apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'\nI thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me\n\nNigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?\nI'ma show you how to turn it up a notch\nFirst you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it\nPool full of liquor, then you dive in it\nI wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock\nAll the girls wanna play Baywatch\nI got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it\nPool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it\n\nPour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)\nSit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)\nPass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)\nFaded (Drank), faded (Drank)\n\nI ride, you ride, bang\nOne chopper, 100 shots, bang\nHop out, do you bang?\nTwo chopper, 200 shots, bang\nI ride, you ride, bang\nOne chopper, 100 shots, bang\nHop out, do you bang?\nTwo chopper, 200 shots, bang\n\nNigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?\nI'ma show you how to turn it up a notch\nFirst you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it\nPool full of liquor, then you dive in it\nI wave a

my new appetite for failure\nAnd I got hunger pain that grow insane\nTell me, do that sound familiar?\nIf it do, then you're like me\nMakin' excuse that your relief\nIs in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf\nAs the window open I release\nEverything that corrode inside of me\nI see you jokin', why you laugh?\nDon't you feel bad? I probably sleep\nAnd never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up\nIn God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough\n\nThey stomped the homie out over a bitch?\nK-dot, you good, blood?\nNow we can drop, ye we can drop you back off\nThat nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'\nWe gon' do the same ol' shit\nI'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways\nFall right in ****'s lap\nAnd he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that\nAnd I hope that bitch that set him up out there\nWe gon' pop that bitch too\nWait hold up, ayy, I see somebody\nAha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?\nL****, you good?\nYeah, blood, I'm good \u2013 Dave, you good?\nDave?

really, real\n\nI promise that I know you very well\nYour eyes never lie, even if they tell\nSweet lullabies that come with a smell\nOf a dozen roses flipping down the green hill\nYou're living in a world that come with plan B\nCause plan A never relay a guarantee\nAnd plan C never could say just what it was\nAnd your plans only can pan around love\nYou love him, you love them, you love her\nYou love so much, you love when love hurts\nYou love red bottom and gold that say \"Queen\"\nYou love hand-bag on the waist of your jean\nYou love French tip and trip that pay for\nYou love bank slip that tell you we paid more\nYou love a good hand whenever the card dealt\nBut what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?\n\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, (cause before you know it, everything's gone)\n\nI promise that I know you very well\nYour eyes never lie, even if they fell\nOut the sky and your optics turn stale\nWhere they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill\nOf living in a world that come with plan B\nCause plan A only can make another mistake\nAnd you can't see success coming from plan C\nWhen it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely\nAnd love them and love when you love her\nYou love so much, you love when love hurts\nYou love fast cars and dead presidents old\nYou love fast women, you love keepin' control\nOf everything that you love, you love beef\nYou love streets, you love running, ducking police\nYou love your hood, might even love it to death\nBut what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?\n\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)\n\nThe reason why I know you very well\nCause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?\nThe days I tried to cover up and conceal\nMy pride, it only made it harder for me to deal\nWhen living in a world that come with plan B\nA scapegoat cause plan A don't come free\nAnd plan C just an excuse like \"because\"\nOr the word \"but,\" but what if I got love?\nI love them, I love when I love her\nI love so much, I love when love hurts\nI love first verse \u2019cause you're the girl I attract\nI love second verse \u2019cause you're the homie that pack\nBurner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch\nI love what the both of you have to offer\nIn fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else\nBut what love got to do with it when I don't love myself\nTo the point I should hate everything I do love?\nShould I hate living my life inside the club?\nShould I hate her for watching me for that reason?\nShould I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?\nShould I hate them for telling me \"ball out\"?\nShould I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about\nHating all money, power, respect in my will\nOr hating the fact none of that shit make me real?\n\nKenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga\n\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)\n\nAlright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom\nBoy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do\n\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\n\n\"If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person.

Lamar\nKing Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw\nFix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it\nPretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us\nAnd I mastered being the master at dodging your honor\nAnd the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning\nThey raid your spot while Kendrick's performing\nAnd if they take everything, know I got\n\nCompton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine\n\nAy, Dre what's happening wit' it my nigga\nStill I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic\nStill I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging\nWhen I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach\nWith a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at\nIt's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap\nIt's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month\nTo a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from\n\nCompton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine\n\nSo come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman\nWon't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga\nKhaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga\nKendrick Conan nigga\nWhere you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that\nI do it big as Rasputia for them shooters\nKama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that\nI'm trying to stay grounded like four flats\nBut I know flats and Piru Crip tats\n\nWill swarm on me like a beehive\nHop in the G ride\nFrom the West to the East side\nKnow that's just how Compton roll\n\nAnd that's a given\nI pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision\nI crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes\nI must report that we import the narcotics you bought it\nThen talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business\nI blow up every time we throw up a record\nDepending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion\nPerfected by niggas that manifested music to live in\n\nCompton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine\n\nSo tell that gangster throw his set high\nRoll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high\nI did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly\nIn my direction, you never questioned when I said I\nWould be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye\nEazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive\nA Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye\nFlying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby\n\nCompton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine\n\nNow we can all celebrate\nWe can all harvest the rap artists of NWA\nAmerica target our rap market, as controversy and hate\nHarsh realities we in made our music translate\nTo the coke dealers, the hood rich\nAnd the broke niggas that play\nWith them gorillas that know killers\nThat know where you stay\nRoll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of ros\u00e9\nThis was brought to you by Dre\nNow every motherfucker in here say:\n\"Look who's responsible\nFor taking Compton international\nI make 'em holla\"\n\nAyo Just Blaze, good looking homie\nJust Blaze\nAin't no city quite like mine, yeah\nIn the city of Compton\nAin't no city quite like mine\n\nMom, I finna use the van real quick!\nBe back, 15 minutes!"}}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
