sunlight\nI bloom and grow so beautifully\nBaby, I'm so proud\nSo proud to be your girl\nYou make the confusion\nGo all away\nFrom this cold and messed up world\nI am in love with you\nYou set me free\nI can't do this thing\nCalled life without you here with me\nCause I'm Dangerously In Love with you\nI'll never leave\nJust keep lovin' me\nThe way I love you loving me\nEvery time I see your face\nMy heart smiles\nEvery time it feels so good\nIt hurts sometimes\nCreated in this world\nTo love and to hold\nTo feel\nTo breathe\nTo live you\nI am in love with you\nYou set me free\nI can't do this thing\nCalled life without you here with me\nCause I'm Dangerously In Love with you\nI'll never leave\nJust keep lovin' me\nThe way I love you loving me\nI love you, I love you, I love you\nDangerously in love\nI love you, I love you, I love you\nHe loves me especially different\nEverytime you keep me on my feet happily\nExcited by your cologne, and your hands\nYour smile, your intelligence\nYou woo me, you court me, you tease me, you please me\nYou school me, give me things to think about\nIgnite me, you excite me\nYou love me and you like me\nIncite me, Incite me to

opened, doorknob turned\nThere appeared your face\n\nGoing outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind\nDrive me crazy burning candles making love all night\nFeels so strange it feels so crazy to be

speechless\n\nLaying so closely\nI feel your skin rubbing and touching me\nOnly sweat between us\nFeeling you kissing and pleasing me\nI rub your back\nI kiss your neck\nI know that you love when we touch like that\nI can feel you need me\nFeels so good to me\nFeels so good to me\n\nGoing outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind\nDrive me crazy burning candles making love all night\nFeels so

leash though\nI'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason\nSending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me\nCome harder, this won't be easy\nDon't doubt yourself trust me you need me\nThis ain't a shoulder with a chip, or an ego\nBut what you think they all mad at me for\n\nYou need a real woman in your life, that's a good look\nTaking care, home is still fly, that's a good look\nI'mma help you build up your account, that's a good look\nBetter yet a hood look, ladies that's a good look\nWhen you're in them big meetings for the mills, that's a good look\nIt take me just to compliment the deals, that's a good look\nAnything you cop I'll split the bill, that's a good look\nBetter yet a hood look, believe me, ladies that's a good look\n\nPartner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet

all\nBig ends, condos, collecting cars\nPicture your life elevating with me\nYou my project celebrity\nI keep your name hot in them streets\nThat little glimpse of light\nMakes that diamond really

me\nWhat's higher than number one\nYou know I used to beat that block\nNow I be's the block (partner let me upgrade you)\n\nI hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on\nNotice you the type, that like to keep them on a leash though\nI'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason\nSending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me\nCome harder, this won't be easy\nDon't doubt yourself trust me you need me\nThis ain't a shoulder with a chip, or an ego\nBut what you think they all mad at me for\n\nYou need a real woman in your life, that's a good look\nTaking care, home is still fly, that's a good look\nI'mma help you build up your account, that's a good look\nBetter yet a hood look, ladies that's a good look\nWhen you're in them big meetings for the mills, that's a good look\nIt take me just to compliment the deals, that's a good look\nAnything you cop I'll split the bill, that's a good look\nBetter yet a hood look, believe me, ladies that's a good look\n\nPartner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you\nSwitch your neck ties to purple labels (Have you rocking purple labels)\nUpgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?\nPartner, let me upgrade you\nFlip a new page, let me upgrade you\nIntroduce you to some new things, and upgrade you\nI can (up), can I (up), let me, upgrade you?\nPartner, let me upgrade you\n\nI can do for you, what Martin did for the people\nRan by the men, but the women keep the tempo\nIt's very seldom, that you're blessed to find your equal\nStill play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me\nI'll follow, this could be easy\nI'll be the help, whenever you need me\nI see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you\nFocused, on your focus I can feed you\n\nYou need a real woman in your life, that's a good look\nTaking care, home is still fly, that's a good look\nI'mma help you build up your account, that's a good look\nBetter yet a hood look, ladies that's a good look\nWhen you're in them big meetings, for the mills, that's a good look\nIt take me just to compliment the deals, that's a good look\nAnything you cop, I'll split the bill, that's a good look\nBetter yet a hood look, believe me, ladies that's a good look\n\nPartner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you\nSwitch your neck ties to purple labels (Have you rocking purple labels)\nUpgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?\nPartner, let me upgrade you\nFlip a new page, let me upgrade you\nIntroduce you to some new things, and (Uh!) upgrade (HOV!) you\nI can (up), (Uh!) can I (up), let me, (HOV!) upgrade you?\nPartner, let me upgrade you,(Uh huh huh!)\n\nI be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes\nThey call shots, I call audibles\nJacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do\nIt's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you\nI'm talking spy bags and fly pads\nAnd rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors\nYou on the verge of a new merge\n'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor\nYou can't fit ya hand in ya new purse\nIt's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting\nIsland-hopping off the Amalfi coast\nMafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?\nNo, not the car, but everywhere we are\nYou're sure to see stars, this is high level\nNot eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars\nI order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you\nMama, let me upgrade you (hehe)\n\nJust when you think we had it all\nBig ends, condos, collecting cars\nPicture your life elevating with me\nYou my project celebrity\nI keep your name hot in them streets\nThat little glimpse of light\nMakes that diamond really shine\nAnd you already is a star\nUnless your flawless\nThen ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me\n\nPartner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you\nSwitch your neck ties to purple labels (Have you rocking purple labels)\nUpgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?\nPartner, let me upgrade you\nFlip a new page, let me upgrade you\nIntroduce you to some new things, and upgrade you\nI can (up), can I (up), let me, upgrade you?\nPartner, let me upgrade you\n\nAudemars Piguet watch, dimples in ya necktie\nHermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips\nSilk-lined blazers, diamond creamed facials\nVVS cuff links, six-star pent suites\nPartna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya\nPartna, partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya\nLet me, let me, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya\nPartna, partna, partna, let me upgrade ya (Huh!)"}}, {"title": "Bonnie And Clyde Medley (The Beyonce Experience Live)", "album": "The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience Live",

she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder\nWhen I'm off track mami is keeping me focused\nSo let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be\nThe '03 Bonnie & Clyde, Hov' and B\nAll I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend\nDown to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend\nAll I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend\nDown to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend\nThe problem is, you dudes treat the one that you loving\nWith the same respect that you treat the one that you humping\nNow they 'bout nothing if ever you mad about something\nIt won't be that, oh no it won't be that\nI don't be at, places where we comfy at\nWith no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that\nAnd no, I ain't perfect, nobody walking this earth's surface is\nBut girlfriend, work

there for you, if somebody hurts you\nEven if it's somebody takes my place\nYeah-hee\n(Break it down for 'em)\nSometimes I trip on how happy we could be\nAnd so I put this on my life\nNobody or nothing will ever come between us\nAnd I promise I'll give my life\nAnd all of my trust if you was my boyfriend\nPut this on my life\nThe air that I breathe in, all that I believe in\nI promise I'll give my life\nAnd all of my trust if you was my boyfriend\nAll I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend\nDown to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend\nAll I need in this life of

me\nI could have another you in a minute\nMatter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby\nYou must not know about me, you must not know about me\nI can have another you by tomorrow\nSo don't you ever
