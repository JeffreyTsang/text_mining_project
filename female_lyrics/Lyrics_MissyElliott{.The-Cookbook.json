"lyrics": "Bet it, bet it taste like candy {*3X*}\n\nI broke up wit my ex I couldn't take his sarcasm\nEverytime we bone I had to fake an orgasm\nMoanin and groanin tried to make him feel manly\nI'd rather use my toys, plus my hands come in handy\nI finally told him that my heart was somewhere else\nWhenever we sexed I wished that he was someone else\nThat dude that approached me at the bar the other night\nThat be the mister right and hot enough to melt some ice\nI think I'm in love like Beyonce be with Jigga\nIt's not his major figure that want him to be my nigga\nHe got that magic stick that make my little pussy quiver\nJuices runnin like a river slowly down my kitty litter\nBoy I'm so glad I found a nigga like you\nA thug like you to make a girl say - oh\nHope he feel as strong as my po hah do\nWith you by my side its like I'm drunk off boo\nIf you be my man only my man I wouldn't mind tastin your magic stick, magic stick\nIf you don't cheat or sleep around ain't nothing wrong wit tastin your magic stick\n\nI bet it taste like candy, made to melt in my mouth\nI know you got plenty, baby you the shit\nNow what you workin wit candy made to melt in my mouth\nI know you got plenty, I like the way, I like the way\nI like the way, I like the way\n\nI like the way you work your stick boo\nThe way you work it like voodoo\nThe way you wind and you wind and you grind\nDon't stop the way you work your stick\nBaby the way you work your stick\nBaby keep on and keep on and keep on keep goin\n\nMy ex boyfriend had to go\nHe didn't know how to work that magic stick\nBut I found a guy that sure do love\nIt's so true his love is cla-hassic yeah oohhh\n\n\n\nI could play Janet you could play J.D\nIf you like Beyonce you could play Jay-Z\nCheck for them other chicks cos they not me\nThey're just some copy cats there's only one Missy\nM-to the I double ss don't test\nI'm hard as the cushion on a bullet proof vest\nBut you got me whipped like slaves in the days\nYou're cool as the shade and ice and lemonade\nI think I wanna marry you baby I will carry\nGuess it's necessary and on the contrary\nYou be mister right and mister legendary\nThe more I fall in love the more it gets scary"}}, {"title": "On & On", "album": "The Cookbook", "year": null, "lyrics": "Beware, you're now listening to the sounds\nOf Mis-demeanor\nTurn everything up, all levels\nAll my fucking levels\nTurn that shit the fuck up\nHuh? What? What?\nIs that a two-track?\n\nMissy be the name and y'all should already know\nBeen around long, Scarface sold coke\nShimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yo she ya\nLet me grab the microphone and I'm gone take it away\n\nEvery time I spit I blow one or two speakers\nTop model diva but my name not Eva\nYeah I bring fever rocking classic adidas\nI'm straight off the heater ripping needles off the meter\nHere I go, flip my flow\nBack it up then I drop it low\nIt's a must cause I'm dangerous\nI'll be a hassle on the busta call me angel dust\nI talk shit di, didn't stutter\n2005 MC's in trouble\nYou run for cover hide under your covers\nCause you gone need more protection than a magnum rubber\n\nAh, ah, on\nAh, ah, on\nAh, ah-ah, ah-ah\nAh, ah, on and it's\n\nMissy finna spit shit simply raw\nMisdemeanor always make MCs feel small\nStick you on the table with a plastic cup\nSay grace, then eat ya ass up\nY'all just rookies, virgins, and nookies\nNot my competition you skip or play hookie\nAin't nobody here that can tear the track up\nAnd naw I ain't done rapping so shut the hell up\nKeep it simple every time I flow\nIf you step to me I shall throw blows\nRaise up like I's break nose\nI ain't about talking I'll lay 'em down slow\nAnd for sure y'all know\nMisdemeanor got 'em by the neck low\nIce cold heart like zero below\nIf you wanna battle me then playa say so\n\n\nLet me tell you what I'm all about\nAbout spitting hot rhymes on out\nYeah Pharrell did the beat oh yes\nAnd the way he put it down he make it sound so (fresh)\nI be the best don't second guess\nWhen it comes to other rappers bout it boy get flexed\nWhen I say I'm tight as wife beaters\nMissy bout to teach you how to follow the leader\nHit the club in a blue two seater\nLooking like I'm finna cock a nine millimeter\nGet out with my high hill cuffs\nTwisting my ass cause I know what guys want\nLicking my lips like I'm taking him home\nTeasing and teasing I'm faking the funk\nShaking my titties like I wanna bone\nBend over slow then I tell him I'm gone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/49c23ba7107cf9bb93749df01b30111c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Missy Elliott", "raw": {"annotation_count": 7, "api_path":
