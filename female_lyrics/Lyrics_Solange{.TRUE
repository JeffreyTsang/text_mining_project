cocoon\n\nLook at me, I'm just a girl still feeling so alone\nLooking at myself thinking, \u201dBest to come and easy go\u201d\nStreet light shining on my room\nLocked up in this old cocoon\n\nOoh, ooh\nOooh, ooh\n\nAnd all I wanted was the dream of being in love with you\nAll I wanted was the dream of being in love with you\nAll I wanted was the dream of being in love with you\nAll I wanted was the dream of being in love with you\n\nWhen I was just a girl I wore a thousand lives\nHeading on a search for the thing that makes me feel alright\nTen black moments in my room\nDiamonds shimmers from the moon\nAnd now I'm just a girl living in the satellite\nTook what I needed from this town and getting down at night\nStreet light shining in my room\nGetting out the suns up soon"}}, {"title":

I loved you\nBut I was not done having my fun\n\nPlayed around with your heart\nNow I'm laying around in the dark\nPlayed around with your heart\nNow I'm paying when we're apart\nPlayed around with your heart\nGuess I played myself from the start\nPlayed around with your heart\n\nWhere oh where's the man\nThat landed in my hands when I say fall\nI pushed you head over my heels\nUntil I pushed you far\nAnd baby I need you\nBut you just don't want nothing at all\n\nBack and forth, behind and down\nWhen you were in, and I was out\nWe chasing lovers in the front part of the parking lot\nAnd baby I'd tell you\nBut you won't give the number to call\n\nPlayed around with your heart\nNow I'm laying around in the dark\nPlayed around with your heart\nNow I'm paying when we're apart\nPlayed around with your heart\nGuess I played myself from the start\nPlayed around with your heart\n\nI want you back, you back, you back\nI've been playing around with your heart too long\nAnd I now I played around and got caught\nAnd now I play myself in the dark\n\nOh baby I've played around with your heart\nAnd now I'm playing around in the dark\nPlayed around with your heart\nNow I'm paying
