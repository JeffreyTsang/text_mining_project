life can seem so unfair\nBut who cares?\nIf I can rise up\nThen I will get there\n\nAnd I'm looking for a place to call my own\nI'm looking for a house to make a home\nI'm looking for a seat upon a throne\nI'm looking for a place to call my own\n\nHey, hey\nThe hottest place to go\nIt's where you've never gone before\nIt takes a brave, brave soul\nBut it makes you much stronger\nNow I feel so alive\nAnd there's no more cries\nI chose to rise up\nAnd there's no denying\n\nThat I finally found a place to call my own\nI finally found a house to make a home\nI finally took a seat upon my throne\nAnd now, I have a place to clal my own\n\nSo many people\nThey try to make you\nMake you believe that\nYou're nothing without them, no\nDon't you believe it\nNot for a minute\nYou gotta show 'em\nThis is my way\n\nNo, I have a place to call my own\nNow, I have a house to make a home\nNow, I have a seat upon a throne\nNow, I have a place to call my own\n\nHey, hey\nI didn't worry about a

love began\nThinkin' of a million ways\nTo escape and be with you\nBut reality wasn't just you and I\nIt was long drawn out days and lonely nights\n\nDream about you\nI keep dreamin' 'bout you\nWhen I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say\n\nLet me take you to another place\nWhere nothing ever seems to matter\nIt's just you and me\nWe can take flight like a thief in the night\nStolen moments with you (oooo)\n\nDestiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)\nI was just a girl and you a young man\nHow could age define\nSomething so divine (so divine)\nCan this even be real or just exist in my mind\n\nDreamin' 'bout you\nI keep dreamin' 'bout you\nWhen I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say\n\nLet me take you to another place\nWhere nothing ever seems to matter\nIt's just you and me\nWe can take flight like a thief in the night\nStolen moments with you (oooo)\n\n\nDreamin' 'bout you\nI keep dreamin' 'bout you\nWhen I'm dreamin' and waitin' for the day\nWhen no one and nothing else takes up our time\nFinally you're only mine\n\nEach and everyday\nI don't walk with you right by my side\nBut instead we have to hide\nSneak around and lie\nJust to spend time alone\nThis lovin' is a crime\nI'd rather do the time\nAnd leave the world behind\n\nLet me take you to another place\nWhere nothin' ever seems to matter\nIt's just you and me\nWe can take flight like a thief in the night\nStolen moments with you (oooo)\n\n\nLet's get away\nLet's get away\nOhh\nWe can get away\nWe can get away\nOhh\nLet's get away\nLet's get away\nOhh\nWe can get away\nWe can get away\nOhhh",
