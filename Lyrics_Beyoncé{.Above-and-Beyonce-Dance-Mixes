the risk that I'm takin'\nI ain't never gonna shut you out\n\n(Halo, halo, I can see your halo)\nEverywhere I'm lookin' now\nI'm surrounded by your embrace\nBaby, I can see your halo\nYou know you're my savin' grace\nYou're everything I need and more\nIt's written all over your face\nBaby, I can feel your halo\nPray it won't fade away\n\nI can feel your halo, halo, halo\nI can see your halo, halo, halo\nI can feel your halo, halo, halo\nI can see your halo, halo\nHalo\n\nHit me like a ray of sun\nBurnin' through my darkest night\nYou're the only one that I want\nThink I'm addicted to your light\nI swore I'd never fall again\nBut this don't even feel like fallin'\nGravity can't begin\nTo pull me back to the ground again\n\nIt's like I've been awakened\nEvery rule I had you breakin'\nThe risk that I'm takin'\nI'm never gonna shut you out\n\nEverywhere I'm lookin' now\nI'm surrounded by your embrace\nBaby, I can see your halo\nYou know you're my savin' grace\nYou're everything I need and more\nIt's written all over your face\nBaby, I can feel your halo\nPray it won't fade away\n\nI can feel your halo, halo, halo\nI can see your halo, halo, halo\nI can feel your halo, halo, halo\nI can see your halo, halo\nHalo\nHalo\nHalo\nOoh\n\nEverywhere I'm lookin' now\nI'm surrounded by your embrace\nBaby, I can see your halo\nYou know you're my savin' grace\nYou're everything I need and

I'd love to not forgive\nAnd though you break my heart, you're the only one\nAnd though there are times when I hate you\n'Cause I can't erase\nThe times that you hurt me\nAnd put tears on my face\nAnd even now while I hate you\nIt pains me to say\nI know I'll be there at the end of the day\n\nI don't wanna be without you, babe\nI don't want a broken heart\nDon't wanna take a breath with out you, babe\nI don't wanna play that part\nI know that I love you\nBut let me just say\nI don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no\nI don't want a broken heart\nAnd I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no\nNo broken-hearted girl\nNo broken-hearted girl\nNo broken-hearted girl\n\nSomething that I feel I need to say\nBut up to now, I've always been afraid\nThat you would never come around\nAnd still I wanna put this out\nYou say you've got the most respect for me\nBut sometimes I feel you're not deserving me\nAnd still you're in my heart\nBut you're the only one\nAnd yes, there are times when I hate you\nBut I don't complain\n'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away\nOh, but now I don't hate you\nI'm happy to say\nThat I will be there at the end of the day\n\nI don't wanna be without you, babe\nI don't want a broken heart\nDon't wanna take a breath with out you, babe\nI don't wanna play that part\nI know that I love you\nBut let me just say\nI don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no\nI don't want a broken heart\nAnd I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no\nNo broken-hearted girl\nNo broken-hearted girl\nNo broken-hearted girl\nNo broken-hearted girl\nNo broken-hearted girl\n\nI don't wanna be without my baby\nI don't wanna a broken heart\nDon't want to take a breath with out my baby\nI don't wanna play that part\nI know that I love you\nBut let me just say\nI don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no\nI don't want a broken heart\nI don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no\nNo broken-hearted girl\nNo

"lyrics": "I got a big ego (Ha ha ha)\nI\u2019m such a big ego (Uh-uh-uh)\nI got a big, (eh-eh-eh), ego\nShe love my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego\nSo stroke my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego\nI like to joke around a little bit, but here we go\nWelcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl, 'cause\nEvery thing I throw up, blow up\nTalking to the girl\nShe said, \"Know what, grow up, you nasty,\"\n\"I don\u2019t understand why they trippin\u2019, if you ask me\"\nFlow is just the nicest\nI emit the propane\nI just spit, probably\nJust raised the gas prices\nEverybody in the club\nTry and get as fresh as me\nWhat you want, dawg?\nTryna stay recession free\nAnd spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium\nYou probably get sweaty\nYou should bring a extra tee\nNow I\u2019m standing next to Jay\nWho standing next to B\nYou coulda been anywhere in the world\nBut you\u2019re here with me\nThat\u2019s good for my ego\nMe and my ego\nAnd it go wherever we go\nMy ego is my imaginary friend\nHe was with me when I was only imagining\nI had dreams of the league\nOne day I play Kobe\nI walk up to Puff and he already know me\nCoulda let the dream killers, kill my self esteem\nOr use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams\nAnd my ego\n\nIt's on baby, let's get lost\nYou don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss\nFor real, want you to show me how you feel\nI consider myself lucky, that's a big deal\nWhy? Well, you got the key to my heart\nBut you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body\nAnd show me secrets, you didn't know was inside\nNo need for me to lie\n\nIt's too big, it's too wide\nIt's too strong, it won't fit\nIt's too much, it's too tough\nHe talk like this cause he can back it up\nHe got a big ego, such a huge ego\nI love his big ego, it's too much\nHe walk like this cause he can back it up\n\nUsually I'm humble, right now I don't choose\nYou can leave with me or you could have the blues\nSome call it arrogant, I call it confident\nYou decide when you find on what I'm working with\nDamn I know I'm killing you with them legs\nBetter yet them thighs\nMatter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes\nBoy you a sight to see, kind of something like me\n\nIt's too big, it's too wide\nIt's too strong, it won't fit\nIt's too much, it's too tough\nI talk like this cause I can back it up\nI got a big ego, such a huge ego\nBut he loves my big ego, it's too much\nI walk like this cause I can back it up\n\nI, I walk like this cause I can back it up\nI, I talk like this cause I can back it up\nI, I can back it up, I can back it up\nI walk like this cause I can back it up\n\nIt's too big, it's too wide\nIt's too strong, it won't fit\nIt's too much, it's too tough\nHe talk like this cause he can back it up\nHe got a big ego, such a huge ego\nI love his big ego, it's too much\nHe walk like this cause he can back it up\n\nEgo so big, you must admit\nI got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch\nEgo so strong, if you ain't know\nI don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...\nWhoa...\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, woo\n(Oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh, oh-oh-oh\nOh, oh-oh-oh\nOh, oh-oh-oh)"}}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
