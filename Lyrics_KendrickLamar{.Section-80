As we stand on our neighborhood corner, know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have. Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front. I recognize all of you. Every creed and color. With that being said... fuck your ethnicity. You understand that? We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you. All of you...\n\nNow everybody, throw your hands up high\nIf you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high\n\nNow I don't give a fuck if you\nBlack, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit\nThat don't mean shit to me\nFuck your ethnicity, nigga\n\nFire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life\nY'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize\nYeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind\nWhat the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war\nMy details be retail, man, I got so much in store\nRacism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines\nFuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse\nThey getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick\nEverybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so I make it my business\nTo give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up\nMan, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up\nMatter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper\nThey sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras\nI mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it\nHad a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind\nSo don't you mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts\nEverybody, please hold up your wallets\nYeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?\nGoing postal, never freeze up, when I approach you\nThat's starstruck and roast you, oh my\nHiiiPower\n\nReporting live from Planet Terminator X\nI saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47\n\nNow I don't give a fuck if you\nBlack, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit\nThat don't mean shit to me\nFuck your ethnicity, nigga\n\nI'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all\nAnd you believe it? Recognize them false achievements\nIt's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off\nKnock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved\nI'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus\nI was kicking that math, dropping that science\nLike an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically I'm UFC\nIf a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien\nDon't alienate my dreams, get it right\nGet a life, I got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do\nBoy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back\nThat a plane or an angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... gross\n\nI mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you\nI'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her\nPut them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower\nAnd the power in the people and if they don't believe us\nThey'll die\nWizard\n\nNow I don't give a fuck if you\nBlack, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit\nThat don't mean shit to me\nFuck your ethnicity, nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1f3cde1d04f886d4d4eb88a2c26a4e4d.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "raw": {"annotation_count": 24, "api_path": "/songs/51797", "apple_music_id": "447516365", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/51797/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["In this opening song, Kendrick launches right into the story of Keisha and Tammy in the loose concept album ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/Kendrick-lamar/Section-80", "rel": "noopener"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/11160"}, "children": [{"tag": "em", "children": ["Section.80"]}]}, ".

Man, I gotta get my wind up\nMan, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up\nMatter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper\nThey sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras\nI mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it\nHad a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind\nSo don't you mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts\nEverybody, please hold up your wallets\nYeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?\nGoing postal, never freeze up, when I approach you\nThat's starstruck and roast you, oh my\nHiiiPower\n\nReporting live from Planet Terminator X\nI saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47\n\nNow I don't give a fuck if you\nBlack, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit\nThat don't mean shit to me\nFuck your ethnicity, nigga\n\nI'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all\nAnd you believe it?

half-weight, nigga, fuck that\nGot a high tolerance when your age don't exist\n\nMan, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again\nPick him up, then I set him in cold water\nThen I order someone to bring him Vicodin\nI hope that take the pain away\nFrom the feelin' that he felt today\nYou know, when you part of Section.80\nAnd you feel like no one can relate\n'Cause you are, you are, a loner,

Compton Boulevard\nWith the top down, screaming \"We don't give a fuck!\"\nDrink my 40 ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt\nCause the kids just ain't alright\n\nOh, shit nigga, somethin' 'bout to happen, nigga, this shit..\nNigga this sound like 30 ki's under the Compton court building\nHope the dogs don't smell it\n\nWelcome to vigilante, 80's so don't you ask me\nI'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry\nPeelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra\nGranny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be\nYou niggas Marcus Camby, washed up\nPussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh\nYou ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane\nTake it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain\nLightnin' bolts hit your body, you thought it rained\nNot a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write\nStrong enough to stand in front of a travellin' freight train, are you trained?\nTo go against Dracula draggin' the record industry by my fangs\nAK clips, money clips and gold chains\nYou walk around with a P90 like it's the 90's\nBullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me that\n\nCompton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with\nBompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with\nCompton \u00e9ses ain't nothin' to fuck with\nBut they fuck with me, and bitch I love it\nWoop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop\nWoop de woop,

check\nSpend it all on a 40-ounce to the neck and\nIn retrospect I remember December being the hottest\nSquad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas\nI tell you mothafuckas that life is full of hydraulics\nUp and down, get a 64, better know how to drive it\nI'm drivin' on E with no license or registration\nHeart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist\n1987, the children of Ronald Reagan, rake the leaves off\nYour front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)\nHe blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)\nHe copping some blow, hopin' that it can stretch\nNewborn massacre, hopping out the passenger\nWith calendars, cause your date's comin'\nRun him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough\nEven the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because\n\nCompton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with\nBompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with\nCompton \u00e9ses ain't nothin' to fuck with\nBut they fuck
