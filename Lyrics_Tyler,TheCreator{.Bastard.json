This food for death, go ahead and fucking eat\nMy father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet\nI cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed\nSomebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed\nThis meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son\n\nMy mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent\nThat I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers\nAre much important I'm getting angrier while recording\nI'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves\nOdd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental\nSimple but probably not, fuck them\n\nI'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck\nDrunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked\nSuspended from school, coolest nigga without effort\nEasy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard\nSoak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on\nCause this album pack enough evil\nThat you can't fit inside a Jansport, go to school with this\n\nI go from AP to JC inside a fucking week\nWaking up with random girls like \"Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?\"\nI stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet\nEvery time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit\nNo to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes\nBy those that were slow as molasses, take this shit to school\n\nRaquel treat me like my father like a fucking stranger\nShe still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her\nNot put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler\nAll because she said no to homecoming, demons running\nInside my heads telling me evil thoughts\nI'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares I caught, go to sleep\n\nI wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky\nFuck me the monster said, somehow the monster's dead\nInside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil\nWith this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble\nI'm on my grind feeble, my music is either\nA fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church\n\nI graduated without honors or fucking father\nHe died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother\nI wanted a brother, my mother I told her\nBut instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada\nSo both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation\nThat's having our brains racing like Dayton, wearing some fucking Heelys\n\nI know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me\nBut times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly\nI'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11\nSeven, what's religion nigga? I am legend\nI roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition\nI created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented\nThan 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci\nWhen they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers\nWith the same problem, the only way to solve them\nIs to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver\nLife's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it\nShit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious\nCause my mother let me do what I want\nShe wasn't careless, protective she is the bear\nThe shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid\nMy father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit\nMy mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents\nWhen Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share\nThis confused boy, I wanna hug hoy, I\u2019m bad for you kids to listen to\nSoy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it\n\nWhoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say\nUh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating\n\nMy wrist is all red from the cutter\nDripping cold blood like the winter, the summer\nIs never that's equivalent to me and Sarah\nWell that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever\nMy niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing\nBut I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing\nWith a tear they try to tell me but I never listen\n'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing\nEighteen, still talking to imaginaries\nHopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy\nLosers can never win me, you can never offend me\nMy goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the\nCeremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal\nThis my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this\nFuck a deal, I just want my father's email\nSo I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail\n\nWow, umm, so Tyler if you had the chance to tell him something\nWhat would you tell him?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cb0b25f99dd81109efa8db270a933a38.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 31, "api_path": "/songs/2093", "apple_music_id": "468152597", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/2093/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["As the essential introduction to his solo musical personality, Tyler goes back and forth with a fictional psychiatrist denominated \u201cDr. TC\u201d in the form of nine unmistakably remarkable verses."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["This song featured intense charisma, trait that attracted many followers to the Odd Future movement and was widely hailed as one of OFWGKTA\u2019s best musical endeavors.

accessorized accessories bring out my assets\nNigga they sound on acid, tablets\nStussy\u2019s G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses\nI suffer from ADHD\nI should win a fucking award for being me\nBeat banging the tom-toms\nMy producer selection is fresh nigga, fuck Vons\nAce the underdog, thrown them on the back bender\nCause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender\nEating Belgian waffles with Italian biscotts\nI sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off\nAnd to you emo kids who walk around pissed off\nStep one: pull your panties down and start to piss off\nStep two: run to your radio, turn this shit off\nNigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help\nSo when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me\nWith Gucci belts, Gucci imprint from leather

expensive dinners and a nice bracelet\nLeave the bitch breathless, what the bitch don't know is that\nI'm a mothafuckin' sellout and a rapist\n\nBaby, you're an angel\nHow about we turn this into a fable of some sort?\nYou already know you're dead\nIronic 'cause your lipstick's red, of course\nI stuff you in the trunk, drunk\n'Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow\n\nIf this was a game, I would be considered a mothafuckin' legend\nAnd I ain't trying to gas you like Chevron\nBut I'm high as fuck bitch, you really need to get on my leverage\nNow we're in the cabin, in the middle of (uhh)\nTrying to find ways to really stuff you in my cabinet\nDreamy little bastard, I done ran outta' luck so now\nIt's time for a bloody foot you little rabbit\nYou're very attractive\nAnd notice that my hat is always the color of cactus\nAnd I hang with wolves 'cause I'm an evil bastard\nPictures of you on my wall no glue, no tape but just cum plastered\nMet you at my school, departed at my house\nEnded at your panties, started at your blouse\nPushed you down stairs, I took a nap up on the couch\nIf you wanted a date, don't come\nNow you gotta make it easy for you don't run\nYou call this shit kids, well I call these kids cum\nAnd you call this shit rape but I think that rape's fun\nWait, now it's about eight something\nIt's late and you stuck down in my base one\nCome downstairs with nothing but a shoe string\nYeah bitch this date's done\n\nBaby, you're an angel\nHow about we turn this into a fable of some sort?\nYou already know you're dead\nIronic 'cause your lipstick's red, of course\nI stuff you in the trunk, drunk\n'Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow\n\nI like my girls how I like my drugs, white\nLord, you're so pretty, lying in my arms\nI just got

their weaves back\nAwesome I achieve that mini, blasting \"You're a jerk\"\nIn some fucking yellow skinnies looking like a fucking faggot\nBouncing 'round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie\nBet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead\nI like my girls smart, skinny\nKinda pop tart, when I bite into them red\nI'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist\nI'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots\nMy hat is by Jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem\nWith the future, you can get a death wish just like Atiba\nFuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant\nI'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent\nA lot of fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed\nThat I'm sharing in the force with the cyclops staring\nI'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever\nSo don't ask for no mothafuckin' ride when you see us\nSwim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew\n'Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes\nPermanent brain damage similar to tattoos\nThe shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you\nKill the jungle, let the cats loose\nYou didn't see me here if someone ask you\n\nI want to feel her in every way\nMary Jane keeps me high like every day\nBong, vaporizer, in the sack now\nStuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped\nBuy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps\nRoll it up and ensure that everything's fat\nShe ain't got time to try and relieve ya\nBut she'll get all in your head, Sativa\n\nI'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables\nI'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals\nLet's take them high like the decibels\nSo we get them high, get them high like cholesterol\nIn a overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber\nThat's fat, who needs another producer?\nChica-Go-Getter from Odd Future, used to ride solo\n'Cause I ain't really care what the rest say\nType of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape\nBest stay away when the door closed, I show up with four hoes\nBest believe I'm leaving with more of those\nAnd I got a girlfriend so I'm a keep lying until the verse end, FIN\nBrandUn DeShay, Hodgy Beats, Ace the Creator\nOdd Future, O.F. until, until from now until forever\n\nWe grind, these niggas asking for some promo\nWe sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos\nSquare circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit\nPreaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet\nNo less profit, fiened when we drop shit\nConvertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split\nIt's that crack, give you something to sell\nPut these bitches on lock down, something like jail\nThought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell\nAnd she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel\nLight skinned women, all sex everything\nThink we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything\nEverything that we call flight, living life\nThis is everything that they call hype\nI'm everything that they call nice\nShe in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right\nIntimidated by niggas you can't be\nI'm a G, and this is something you can't see\nTop ranked, number one my son\nAnd she looking for them trees, baby we got some\nAnd stay focused on the women and you get less done\nIt's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one\nThem other niggas smoke, they ain't this high\nHow high?

fuck of it, no fame\nAim, shoot, the gun of love, round\nTried to find ammo but it's none around town\nSo I went Down South but I ended up North\nUptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch\nAnd of course, my car's off course\nYou're so white, my blinkers don't work\nI'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you\nMusic is my first, but I contemplate divorce\nYou make a nigga sing songs nice\nYou make a nigga's night turn day\nAnd you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow\nIt sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello\nI want to eat you out like jello\nAnd mess with your body like the bass and the cello\nAnd tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom? (Nigga hell no)\nFuck (Shit) and another one, there goes another one\n\nAnother love song about shit\nAnd I'll be rich if I get another diss\nAnd maybe Cupid won't miss\nAnother love song about shit\nAnd I'll be rich if I get another diss\nAnd maybe Cupid won't miss\n\nMaybe?

Maybe\nBut fucked up is how I been lately\nShit, I don't give a fuck\nYour family looking for you, wish 'em good luck\nBitch, you tried to play me like a dummy\nNow you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody\nAnd I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy\nLooking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?\nWhat did you want from me?\nWhat did you want from me?"}}, {"title": "Jack and the Beanstalk", "album": "Bastard", "year": "2009-12-25", "lyrics": "They don't paint pictures, they just trace me\n\nOdd Future, I'm your mothafucking sergeant\nNigga, I'm in charge, I fuck with Freshjive\nCause I get it, no charge, and BBC for the low price\nNo barging, nigga that's a bargain\nCow print t-shirt like mothafucking dog\nOn the mothafucking farm with cockadoddle doodles\nI'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle\nAnd my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles\nFelines on the free time, I'm tossing bitches' salads\nAnd I'm eating up they croutons, Erica to Milan\nWe was flying to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok\nUntil she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock\nTo Soho, Baby Milo so dope\nThe cocaine flow, niggas spit heat, propane\nNiggas get the picture, I see, why?\n(They don't paint pictures, they just trace me)\n\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nNo hook, fuck a hook\n\nYo, beside me, nobody likes me\nMainly because I am not a fucking HypeBeast\nI think Supreme suck, we gnarly in our Nikes\nI can wear some Wranglers, with a fucking White T\nDoo-rags to match, and I do sag\nIn fact, my hat is in tact with the Fubu pull over\nNigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range\nAnd I'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange\nAnd I'm the only fucking rapper without a chain\nWith a four finger ring like I can't spell my fucking name\nAnd I go to Obama rallies screaming out \"McCain\"\nThem ignorant thrashing mothafuckers is my gang\nAnd the dirty Ladera, I can't forget where I came from\nNigga, you don't claim none, fun I am the teacher\nWhite and black bitch like she's a mothafucking zebra\nCandies in my pocket, I see you niggas on Easter\n\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nNo hook, fuck a hook\n\n(It's gold) The gold is in the back\n(It's gold) The bitch is in the front\n(It's gold) The beat's a fucking bully\n(Go home) The lyric's just a punk, man\n(Gold) The pink is in the sky\n(That shit's gold) The gold is in my mind\n(It's gold) The mind is in my gold\nThe beat is turning old, so go\n\nSynthesizer, I'm the mothafucking master\nNigga, I'm a bastard, I fuck with chord keys\nCause the sound lasts longer, bass drummer song\nAnd a hi-hat made of plastic, nigga's sound is elastic\nNigga, you can bite this, unless you want to bite back\nI didn't take my fucking Ritalin, this is a hype track\nHypeTrack that and send it, nigga it's a sack shit\nI had you motherfuckers eating salad like a fat bitch\n\nDrop it, Ace the Creator, O.F.M, banging on your FM\nAce the Creator, drop the drums, nigga, thank you to HypeBeast", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cb0b25f99dd81109efa8db270a933a38.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 10, "api_path": "/songs/4687", "apple_music_id": null, "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/4687/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/Joseph-jacobs-jack-and-the-beanstalk-annotated/", "rel": "noopener"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/523571"}, "children": [{"tag": "em", "children": ["Jack and the Beanstalk"]}]}, " is a traditional English fairy tale with obscure origins, but dating back to at least the 16th century."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["The song\u2019s title references a line in the ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/128218", "rel": "noopener"}, "children": ["previous song on this album, \u201cBastard\u201d"]}, ".

mothafucking sergeant\nNigga, I'm in charge, I fuck with Freshjive\nCause I get it, no charge, and BBC for the low price\nNo barging, nigga that's a bargain\nCow print t-shirt like mothafucking dog\nOn the mothafucking farm with cockadoddle doodles\nI'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle\nAnd my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles\nFelines on the free time, I'm tossing bitches' salads\nAnd I'm eating up they croutons, Erica to Milan\nWe was flying to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok\nUntil she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock\nTo Soho, Baby Milo so dope\nThe cocaine flow, niggas spit heat, propane\nNiggas get the picture, I see, why?\n(They don't paint pictures, they just trace me)\n\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nNo hook, fuck a hook\n\nYo, beside me, nobody likes me\nMainly because I am not a fucking HypeBeast\nI think Supreme suck, we gnarly in our Nikes\nI can wear some Wranglers, with a fucking White T\nDoo-rags to match, and I do sag\nIn fact, my hat is in tact with the Fubu pull over\nNigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range\nAnd I'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange\nAnd I'm the only fucking rapper without a chain\nWith a four finger ring like I can't spell my fucking name\nAnd I go to Obama rallies screaming out \"McCain\"\nThem ignorant thrashing mothafuckers is my gang\nAnd the dirty Ladera, I can't forget where I came from\nNigga, you don't claim none, fun I am the teacher\nWhite and black bitch like she's a mothafucking zebra\nCandies in my pocket, I see you niggas on Easter\n\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nMy nigga, no hook\nNo hook, fuck a hook\n\n(It's gold) The gold is in the back\n(It's gold) The bitch is in the front\n(It's gold) The beat's a fucking bully\n(Go home) The lyric's just a punk, man\n(Gold) The pink is in the sky\n(That shit's gold) The gold is in my mind\n(It's gold) The mind is in my gold\nThe beat is turning old, so go\n\nSynthesizer, I'm the mothafucking master\nNigga, I'm a bastard, I fuck with chord keys\nCause the sound lasts longer, bass drummer song\nAnd a hi-hat made of plastic, nigga's sound is elastic\nNigga, you can bite this, unless you want to bite back\nI didn't take my fucking Ritalin, this is a hype track\nHypeTrack that and send it, nigga it's a sack shit\nI had you motherfuckers eating salad like a fat bitch\n\nDrop it, Ace the Creator, O.F.M, banging on your FM\nAce the Creator, drop the drums, nigga, thank you to

we end this?\n\nMy father died the day I came out of my mother's hole\nAnd left a burden on my soul, until I was old enough\nTo understand that the fuckin' faggot didn't like me much\nHe loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he Shake Junt\nBring your pops to school day, for twelve years, I cheated\nTold the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meetin' and\nBring that dude to life day, he wasn't at the meetin'\nMade a U-turn on the way there like; \"the fuck am I thinkin'\"\nBirthdays, Christmas, my only fuckin' wishlist\nWas CDs (and a father) and a new fitted\nInstead I got some CDs, inhaler, some Ritalin, some white socks\nI was hyper, 'cause I didn't get attention from my real pops\nCops say I'm supposed to be in jail, but they don't know it's me\nStatistics say that niggas with no father ain't gon' be shit (nigga)\nWell I guess I had one because nigga I'm it\nYou smell that? (Yeah!) That's the odor of success, bitch\n\nI know I'm not the only bastard in America\nSo I'm gon' to need some help, on this next part\nScream it with me, niggas\n\nFuck you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I graduated)\nWithout you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nNigga, eighteen (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nGot a car, nigga (fuck you)\nEat a dick, nigga, bitch\n\nFather's Day was the worst when it came to gifts\n'Cause I ain't know for who or what the fuck to get\nNow my momma mentioned the day before what she would like\n'Cause she's playin' both roles, like her occupation was dyke, fuckin' right\nI ain't look up to Obama and Nixon\nI look up to the Hugos and Dixons\nThe niggas in the vision rap about the shit they cookin' in the kitchen\nPushin' keys, like them niggas that were bangin' on the keys\nMy father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie\nHe bought me a hoodie, a couple albums\nLike that's gon' make up for the years and the tears\nAnd the money that my momma spent on rent and clothes\nYou fuckin' dipped out, I swear to God, if I see you\nI'm a get out the M-16 and let a fuckin' clip out (RRRAAA!)\n'Cause in 16 years, you let your kid doubt the existence, none\nI don't give a fuck either, like father, like son, I'm done\n\nHe ain't give a fuck about me\nHe ain't give a fuck about you\nHe ain't give a fuck about we\nSo what the fuck we gon' do?\n\nFuck you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I graduated)\nWithout you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nNigga, eighteen (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nGot a car, nigga (fuck you)\nEat a dick, nigga, bitch\n\nThe cold is nice, and I'm not talkin' 'bout the weather\nThe skin is thick, no need for leather, your father called\nHe said you're better without him, I'm not the only fuck\nWithout them, how to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed up\nTake it to the shop, then what?\nFuck it, momma's proud of her asthmatic, thin fuck\nLuck on my brim, Supreme keeps me warm\nWhen the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer\nThe bummer is the fact that I'm black\nAnd I hang with white Neos whose marrow stays frio\nNow this counselor is tryna tell me that I'm emo\nShe don't give a fuck\nD-low where's the trigger? I'll let this bullet play hero\n\nNah, fuck that\nFuck that\nI ain't deserve this\nI'm over it\nBANG!"}}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
