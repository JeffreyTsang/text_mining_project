that move real quick like Nestle\nLet me make it clear for a second like Pepsi\nI was never worried 'bout my wallet being empty\nCause when it was empty, I was still happy\nWalkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin'\nHigh school bullies like what the fuck happened\nNigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain\nAnd this is me relaxing, rappin' is my hobby\nI did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry\nWatchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station\nYou are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)\nWhy you doing this, what's your motivation?\nI am just a rapper, I don't need the paper\nNo Will Smith went off without a hitch man\nC-H-I-L-D is the ISH man\nDo sixteen bars no wristband\nI'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson\nRun the track like my tongue's an Olympian\nI've always been this good, you just weren't listenin'\n\nI'mma try to make my street cred stack up\nI mean I'm rapping over Grizzly Bear, what the fuck?\nGather swagger up, before I take it all\nYou started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball\nI started rapping cause I fucking need some Adderall\nI can't do one thing, I'm just too good\nI can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods\nI make your iPod hotter than a lighter would\nPicture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite\nGot my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe\nKid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy\nFrodo from Chicago, really small and shy\nYou better recognize, cause I know better now\nCause I was always sick, my life's a hospital\nAnd that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow\nThat female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!\nI'm wearing tight jeans and nobody's laughing\nMore pussy than recycled sanitary napkins\nBitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman\nI did exactly what you niggas said would never happen\nI'm doing me so big I can hardly walk\nThese rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park\nStay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark\nThis kind of music make your balls drop, Dick Clark\nYes I'm grown and sexy and I'm worth the wait\nGirls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date\nPut these words on your head and let them percolate\nWe need to separate, nigga church and state\nI used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn\nAnd now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor\nIf living my life is what you say you're chasing after\nNigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper (Be a rapper)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/71b32f259d92f0db0dfeba38136bbd3e.320x320x1.jpg", "artist": "Childish Gambino", "raw": {"annotation_count": 16,

clear for a second like Pepsi\nI was never worried 'bout my wallet being empty\nCause when it was empty, I was still happy\nWalkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin'\nHigh school bullies like what the fuck happened\nNigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain\nAnd this is me relaxing, rappin' is my hobby\nI did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry\nWatchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station\nYou are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)\nWhy you doing this, what's your motivation?\nI am just a rapper, I don't need the paper\nNo Will Smith went off without a hitch man\nC-H-I-L-D is the ISH man\nDo sixteen bars no wristband\nI'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson\nRun the track like my tongue's an Olympian\nI've always been this good, you just weren't listenin'\n\nI'mma try to make my street cred stack up\nI mean I'm rapping over Grizzly Bear, what the fuck?\nGather swagger up, before I take it all\nYou started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball\nI started rapping cause I fucking need some Adderall\nI can't do one thing, I'm just too good\nI can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods\nI make your iPod hotter than a lighter would\nPicture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite\nGot my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe\nKid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy\nFrodo from Chicago, really small and shy\nYou better recognize, cause I know better now\nCause I was always sick, my life's a hospital\nAnd that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow\nThat female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!\nI'm wearing tight jeans and nobody's laughing\nMore pussy than recycled sanitary napkins\nBitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman\nI did exactly what you niggas said would never happen\nI'm doing me so big I can hardly walk\nThese rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park\nStay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark\nThis kind of music make your balls drop, Dick Clark\nYes I'm grown and sexy and I'm worth the wait\nGirls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date\nPut these words on your head and let them percolate\nWe need to separate, nigga church and state\nI used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn\nAnd now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor\nIf living my life is what you say you're chasing after\nNigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper (Be a rapper)"}}, {"title": "49ers (Orange Shirt)", "album": "I AM JUST A RAPPER", "year": "2010-01-05", "lyrics": "Whoa!\nWhat'd you get, amnesia?\nI bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was Lil' Weezy, huh?\nBet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was in a band or something\nAnd my bank balance were around a grand or something\nAsk you something:\nDo you think I'm common like sense is?\nThat heaven didn't send this\nUniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then\nBut you know, I know, I'd make a damn good boyfriend\nOil can, oil can\nYou think I'm the Tin Man\nYou took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can\nAin't you heard I got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?\nIn the lean time don't come crying for the thin man\nIn the meantime I'll be building my portfolio\nAll these other dudes eradicated like polio\nWith any luck you'll see me everywhere like Starbucks\nI bet you'll wanna fuck me when it's time to star fuck\n\nI didn't have green like an Arizona front lawn\nNow they try to touch my face like an iPhone\nNow I'm all gassed up like Exxon\nGirls see the money like I fucking got checks on\nI don't even know if this girl really likes me\nPicking up the check like I'm working at Nike\nTalking to this girl and I'm thinking that she's into me\nThen I find out she's trying to break in the industry\nThat's really lame\nI still hit it\nBut I refuse to be home girl's meal ticket\nI'm looking for a sick girl to be a part of me\nNot a girl who will try to McCartney me\nYes, homie I'm a man of my word\nGot this shit in the can like a toilet of turd\nAnd, yes, these gold diggers trying to get at my sperm\nWell, I'm not a 49ers fan, in case you haven't heard\nI know my girl out there somewhere\nAnd if you hear this, you should come here\nUnless you don't give head like a weird beer\nElroy, Bam-B, yeah, I'm outta here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/71b32f259d92f0db0dfeba38136bbd3e.320x320x1.jpg", "artist": "Childish Gambino", "raw":

something\nAnd my bank balance were around a grand or something\nAsk you something:\nDo you think I'm common like sense is?\nThat heaven didn't send this\nUniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then\nBut you know, I know, I'd make a damn good boyfriend\nOil can, oil can\nYou think I'm the Tin Man\nYou took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can\nAin't you heard I got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?\nIn the lean time don't come crying for the thin man\nIn the meantime I'll be building my portfolio\nAll these other dudes eradicated like polio\nWith any luck you'll see me everywhere like Starbucks\nI bet you'll wanna fuck me when it's time to star fuck\n\nI didn't have green like an Arizona front lawn\nNow they try to touch my face like an iPhone\nNow I'm all gassed up like Exxon\nGirls see the money like I fucking got checks on\nI don't even know if this girl really likes me\nPicking up the check like I'm working at Nike\nTalking to this girl and I'm thinking that she's into me\nThen I find out she's trying to break in the industry\nThat's really lame\nI still hit it\nBut I refuse to be home girl's meal ticket\nI'm looking for a sick girl to be a part of me\nNot a girl who will try to McCartney me\nYes, homie I'm a man of my word\nGot this shit in the can like a toilet of turd\nAnd, yes, these gold diggers trying to get at my sperm\nWell, I'm not a 49ers fan, in case you haven't heard\nI know my girl out there somewhere\nAnd if you hear this, you should come here\nUnless you don't give head like a weird beer\nElroy, Bam-B, yeah, I'm outta here"}}, {"title": "My Girls", "album": "I AM JUST A RAPPER", "year": "2010-01-05", "lyrics": "In the fourth grade I had a crush on Tia Smith\nSixth grade and this crush is turned to Beatrice\nBut

credentials\nSick boy is my clique\nI got that shit inside a headlock\nLove to make that bam bam\nWe were born to make the bed rock\nI am so hip hop\nMore so than you guys\nI am legend\nYou guys are true lies\nTipsy like some Jenga\nShout out to my topangas\nThem thicky thick girls stay wrapped around my finga\nNerdy girls from every where\nThey scope me out like there he is\nMy whole crew's sick\nI'm hanging out with Jerry's Kids\nHold up mother fucker\nIt's gambini on the microphone\nScreaming like your father when he comes home and the light are on\nGirls addicted to my dick\nMy wallet is their methadone\nBrain dead niggas love beef\nThey are vegetables\nI am on that fly shit\nFuck that, I'm orbiting\nMy face is everywhere\nFuck that, I'm Norbiting\nI can feel your heat, momma\nI

classic\nDamn right we got a t-rex, I paid for that in plastic\nClumsy archeologist about to drop a classic\nMistake still burning but I'm learning like a raptor\nTake what I'm given make it work like an adapter\nMake short work of her, then I will adapt her\nCritics all agree it was the work of a master\nAt last my success will match my fatigue\nAnd at last I'll send my children to an ivy league\nIn the masks from The Strangers, freak the whole place out\nGet your glasses on, girl, geek your whole face out\nDon't open up your mouth unless to let something great out\nAnd that's not a beef, that's just a peek at the steakhouse\nA week at my maid's house to recharge my battery\nThen I'll be right back on top like Slattery\nYou know from Sterling and Cooper\nIf she's paid out then I will recoup her\nAnd if she's paid out then I will invest\nAnd if she's really played out then I will impress\nUpon her the need to please please me, whoa yeah\nGirl I'm on my knees, Ooh, I need it so bad\nIt's like I work at NORAD\nIt's DEFCON-5\nGo out back to my car and drive\nCause shit just got real\nTake a thirty wreck drive into a field\nPass out in my vehicle\nHope I wake up in a world more agreeable\nHope I wake aboard unidentified flying objects\nOr a reject Enterprise\nA Starfleet drop out odyssey\nA route to cop out galaxies\n'Til then I'm in the light, right where the moths are\nImpressive, depressive I'm a Goth Star\n\nI do not talk, I am just a rapper\nNigga I'm on\nNiggas try to off me\nLike these girls like I like my coffee\nIn my lap Fuck this track\nIt goes off beat but I'm on like clap\nAnd dog, you can have my scraps\nI'm close to these girls like her tampon flaps\nI'm having an effect on the hood like crack\nEven though I'm so suburban like a backpack strap\nDon't you get it? Read Ayn Rand\nThen you'll understand why they call me the man\nI'm just fucking special-er\nDifferent from you other guys\nHating me in high school made me metamorphosize\nKafka-esque, The way I dress\nI need to send Bo Diddley some checks\nOn Marc Jacobs, Commes Des Garcon tie\nDiddy is my swagger coach, can't stop, won't stop\nHeavy hitter, short stop, horse face, horse cock\nBouncer, door stop, tell me when enough's enough\nLooking at me warming up, microwave a nigga flow\nPity y'all don't see me though the rest of y'all already know\nI get it like I gotta, man, Flier like a college band\nNiggas looking for a deal and I cut out the middle man\nDrinking fucking grape juice, early at a wine bar\nBlacker than Depeche Mode so I'm a Goth Star", "image":

t-rex, I paid for that in plastic\nClumsy archeologist about to drop a classic\nMistake still burning but I'm learning like a raptor\nTake what I'm given make it work like an adapter\nMake short work of her, then I will adapt her\nCritics all agree it was the work of a master\nAt last my success will match my fatigue\nAnd at last I'll send my children to an ivy league\nIn the masks from The Strangers, freak the whole place out\nGet your glasses on, girl, geek your whole face out\nDon't open up your mouth unless to let something great out\nAnd that's not a beef, that's just a peek at the steakhouse\nA week at my maid's house to recharge my battery\nThen I'll be right back on top like Slattery\nYou know from Sterling and Cooper\nIf she's paid out then I will recoup her\nAnd if she's paid out then I will invest\nAnd if she's really played out then I will impress\nUpon her the need to please please me, whoa yeah\nGirl I'm on my knees, Ooh, I need it so bad\nIt's like I work at NORAD\nIt's DEFCON-5\nGo out back to my car and drive\nCause shit just got real\nTake a thirty wreck drive into a field\nPass out in my vehicle\nHope I wake up in a world more agreeable\nHope I wake aboard unidentified flying objects\nOr a reject Enterprise\nA Starfleet drop out odyssey\nA route to cop out galaxies\n'Til then I'm in the light, right where the moths are\nImpressive, depressive I'm a Goth Star\n\nI do not talk, I am just a rapper\nNigga I'm on\nNiggas try to off me\nLike these girls like I like my coffee\nIn my lap Fuck this track\nIt goes off beat but I'm on like clap\nAnd dog, you can have my scraps\nI'm close to these girls like her tampon flaps\nI'm having an effect on the hood like crack\nEven though I'm so suburban like a backpack strap\nDon't you get it? Read Ayn Rand\nThen you'll understand why they call me the man\nI'm just fucking special-er\nDifferent from you other guys\nHating me in high school made me metamorphosize\nKafka-esque, The way I dress\nI need to send Bo Diddley some checks\nOn Marc Jacobs, Commes Des Garcon tie\nDiddy is my swagger coach, can't stop, won't stop\nHeavy hitter, short stop, horse face, horse cock\nBouncer, door stop, tell me when enough's enough\nLooking at me warming up, microwave a nigga flow\nPity y'all don't see me though the rest of y'all already know\nI get it like I gotta, man, Flier like a college band\nNiggas looking for a deal and I cut out the middle man\nDrinking fucking grape juice, early at a wine bar\nBlacker than Depeche Mode so I'm a Goth Star"}}, {"title": "I Love Clothes", "album":

it\nOne shirt, eight dubs, I'm spending it\nGot shoes that I know I won't wear\nAnd the problem is I don't really care\nGot money, but nothing is forever\nEvery time I'm out to buy a new sweater\nBy 211 I'll be dead broke\nI'll be the homeless dude in a peacoat\n\nI love clothes\nI love clothes\nI love clothes\nI love clothes"}}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
