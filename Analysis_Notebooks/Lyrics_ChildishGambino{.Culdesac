solved\nDrunk off the high life, death is when I sleep it off\nLife's a hangover and this rappin' shit's my Tylenol\nI could call any girl in my phone right now\nHave a pillow in her mouth, watch her bite down\nShe like me cause I'm flier than a kite now\nIt's funny how I get these write ups on what I write down\nChick on my left arm, she could write The King And I\nI'd rather die the truth, these niggas live a lie\nDressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized\nSee me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes\nAlways do me like I love self portraits\nNow these fake niggas say \"Hey\" like horse shit\nPeople treat me different but I'm still the same person\nI don't know what it means, I just know that it's worth it\nI know I'm not perfect, but I am original\nWallet stay healthy: vitamins, minerals\nGotta feed the bitch right, stuff her full of spinach\nFacebook messages askin' how I did it\nNo time to respond, time is money, life's a debit card\nSpend it on the right shit, these bitches want you overdrawn\nDrake with dyslexia, I have gone so far\nMy life is a green light, I always try and go hard\n\nI am just different\n\nI am so different, the game's on lid eye\nListen to my mixtape, change your whole shit up\nSalad backstage, I just wanna eat alone\nCrowd at my shows more mixed than Rashida Jones\nHaters say I'm changin', but I haven't changed at all\nIndie kids saying that I've ruined all their favorite songs\nHood niggas sayin' that I'm whiter than that Colgate\nHatin' on my progress, I'm a long ways from Bro Rape\nBlack Clark Kent, all I need's a Lois Lane\nBut let her spend the night once and watch her go insane\nVoice mail, e-mail, sendin' text message\nWe are not engaged just because I made breakfast\nBelieve me you don't want this, I'm all about business\nLife is a bitch, I must be datin' her sisters\nGotta be different, take chances like pictures\nEmerge victorious, stunt on y'all bitches\nI'm not at the top, but ya'll niggas know I'm comin' fast\nRap will change after me, all of this will come to pass\nRappers start to use real instruments and shit\nNiggas start to copy me, dumb it down and make it rich\nI am not a novelty, just the first to do it different\nI have always been this good, you were just laughing too hard to listen\nGot my career overnighted, maybe you should order one\nSpringsteen this city 'cause this city we were born to run\n\nI am just different\nI am just different\nI've always been different\nI am just different", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7fb2bc257978c0cab9de60c94b6542d5.320x320x1.jpg",

rich, call a bitch, fresher than my lozenges\nThe problem is you in the Danger Zone like Kenny Loggins is\nI'm fly, I'm tight, they say I'm sick, they right\nYou think you good, I swear I put your shit to bed, good night\nYes, I'm sitting on the bench, I don't play no games\nI just spit that Bellevue, watch them go insane\nWhy these motherfuckers think they waking up in pain?\n'Cause they sleeping on the hardest nigga in this game\nHell yes, I'm on my zombie shit, I must get brain\nThey will not forget me like I was hit by planes\nI ain't got to do it big, I just gotta do it different\nAnd these hoes are on my dick, and if you got it, it ain't tricking\nI be steady getting paper, call a nigga Dunder Mifflin\nAnd these rappers cannot see me, I'm the only one with vision\n\nI be on that other shit, I be on that other shit\nI be on that other shit and you can't handle none of it\nI be on that other shit, I be on that other shit\nI be on that other shit and you can't handle none of it\n\nI'm on top of turd mountain; king shit, bitches\nCan't nobody top that, Teen Witch, bitches\nI don't make it rain, I bring the heat storm, nigga\nWeezy F is in jail, I keep his seat warm, nigga\nYes, I get it like I live it, yes, this pimp is still is pimping\nY'all don't want me to be different, what the fuck is y'all thinking?\nThat does not suit me, call it Ben Sherman\n'Cause I get more green than Kermit, heard me?\nI'm in charge of new shit, don't talk\u2014do shit\nSpitting at the crowd like I play heavy metal music\nI can say anything, call me John Cusack\nKeep my dick wetter than the bottom of a cruise ship\nKeep it fresh to death, keep my swag inside a coffin\nSo fly, I'm in the sky like Vodka, partner\nShout out to Marc Jacobs, yeah, my feet be feeling highbrow\nAnd Band of Outsiders, got your tie on right now\nGlory versus failure, there is nothing to it\n'Cause you win some and lose some, Sandra Bullock\nTell me when I'm way too much, when no one had faith in us\nThey thought Child was child's play, but now, they see we dangerous\nBring your girl around me, let me show her how her body work\nShe like me 'cause my wallet fat, it should wear a Hawaiian shirt\nComin' for your spot, like I do when I'm inside of her\nGot the cold, hard green in my hand, no Heineken\nListen up, listen up, please, check my steez\nInsect ligaments, I'm the bee's knees\nWatch my math, like 75 minus 6\nHow can number two be number one? Because I'm the shit, bitch\n\nI be on that other shit, I be on that other shit\nI be on that other shit and you can't handle none of it\nI be on that other shit, I be on that other shit\nI be on that other shit and you can't handle none of it"}}, {"title": "Got This Money", "album": "Culdesac", "year": "2010-07-03", "lyrics": "I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you\nI got this Sunday,

hide\nEverywhere that I go, you'll be right by my side\nYou're the only girl that I have ever dreamed of\nI wanna tell you everything, but everything just seems dumb\n\nI kinda like you, girl, really

baby, I don't talk\nYes, I run this shit, like it's hard to walk\nAnd you think that I'm dope, like a mound of chalk\nI'm recession proof, I work to relax, ho\nWeird voice catch beef like a lasso\nNew fresh prince, you can chill in my castle\nSpit real shit, so I must be an asshole, right?\nNah, that's why I'm makin' out in your car\nThese blogs are a dude's A&R\nGot a big tip for these girls at the bar\nBut I don't mean money\nEver since the money, they just treat me funny\nGirls look good, she can take green from me\nAin't trickin' if you got it, know what I mean, buddy?\n\nYou've got your yellow sun dress on\nI'm tryna write you the best song\nWith your Wayfarer shades, you drive me insane\nI wanna hold hands, and call you pet names\n\nI kinda like you, girl, really wanna dress you up\nI wanna buy you for real\nI kinda like you, girl, really wanna feel you up\nI wanna feel you for real\n\nI got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you\nI got this Sunday, baby, I wanna spend it

promise then, I'll be true\nI got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you, oh\n\nI don't really know where to go, don't know where to hide\nEverywhere that I go, you'll be right by my side\nYou're the only girl that I have ever dreamed of\nI wanna tell you everything, but everything just seems dumb\n\nI kinda like you, girl, really wanna dress you up\nI wanna buy you for real\nI kinda like you, girl, really wanna feel you up\nI wanna feel you for real\n\nI got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you\nI got this Sunday, baby, I wanna spend it with you\nWe can do what you like, I promise then, I'll be true\nI got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you, oh\n\nI got an upstairs, downstairs in my loft\nCheck the mixtape, baby, I don't talk\nYes, I run this shit, like it's hard to walk\nAnd you think that I'm dope, like a mound of chalk\nI'm recession proof, I work to relax, ho\nWeird voice catch beef like a lasso\nNew fresh prince, you can chill in my castle\nSpit real shit, so I must be an asshole, right?\nNah, that's why I'm makin' out in your car\nThese blogs are a dude's A&R\nGot a big tip for these girls at the bar\nBut I don't mean money\nEver since the money, they just treat me funny\nGirls look good, she can take green from me\nAin't trickin' if you got it, know what I mean, buddy?\n\nYou've got your yellow sun dress on\nI'm tryna write you the best song\nWith your Wayfarer shades, you drive me insane\nI wanna hold hands, and call you pet names\n\nI kinda like you, girl, really wanna dress you up\nI wanna buy you for real\nI kinda like you, girl, really wanna feel you up\nI wanna feel you for real\n\nI got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you\nI got this Sunday, baby, I wanna spend it with you\nWe can do what you like, I promise then, I'll be

then you can blow me\nThese dollars in my pocket getting big, I gotta fold it\nIt's Cheezy in the building, more cheese than macaroni\nWhat the fuck is going on?\nI'm in her bush, before I eat, I make her mow the lawn\nMy career is like award shows, it's going long\nI make it look real easy, like I'm showing thong, huh\n(Bitch, you know me)\nI do a shot, and then I'll sip a Sobe\nI'm walking weird 'cause it's Walker that I'm wasted on\nPeople just realizing that I'm awesome, why they take so long?\nSkip around the album, it's not hard to find your favorite song\nPussy and these tracks the only things that I go crazy on\nLet me slow it down a sec, man, I cannot not be sick\nHook me up with Dimetapp\n(Bitch, you know me)\nYou think you better than I am, then show me\nThese niggas don't talk that much shit unless you let them\nAnd I let them, 'cause they know if you reply, then you respect them\nI've been working for a minute, hope this album's a success\nI'm not tryna to do Drake numbers, I'm just tryna do my best\n'Cause let's face it, if I wasn't working with Tina on pitches\nI would probably flood the market, and go Katrina, you bitches, uh\n\n(Bitch, you know me)\nI'm sorry mama, but there isn't an old me\nThat nigga dead, but I promise, he won't die in vain\nAll I trust is money, fuck these niggas like the Crying Game\nThis is not a joke. You won't listen to what I'm sayin'\nAnd I promise to destroy any nigga who think I'm playin'\nKnow my verses can be silly, but I'm choosing not to spray rounds\nMy verse is pedophiles on the playground, okay now?\n(Bitch, you know me)\nHalf-price flat screens, yes, I work for Sony\nI kiss her hard and hit the jet, I make out like a bandit\nThey trying hard to hate me, I just don't understand it\nScreamin' at me, \"When you gonna stick to the right business\nAnd stop making rap music for these White kids-es?\"\nHuh, I make music for these tight kids\nDon't be a fucking asshole, one day, you'll have to wipe his\n(Bitch, you know me)\nI know what I am, and I'll never be hovy\n'Cause I am just different, I'm being what I am, man\nI don't need a Jesus piece, my jacket cost me 10 grand\nI'm going light speed, and I don't care if you can't see us\n'Cause I will never stop, like I am cruising in a Prius\nYou talk from far away because my money's between us\nAnd I'm working hard as hell, until I'm chilling with Aaliyah\nBitch, you know me\nBitch"}}, {"title": "Let Me Dope You", "album": "Culdesac", "year": "2010-07-03", "lyrics": "Welcome to the culdesac, this is where the

a rapper, I ain't got the time for speakin'\nNigga stay weak like tornado and a tree branch\nI never have a weak day, my life's a long weekend\nFuckin' with ya raw, bitch, my mouth should get tested\nSleepin' on a nigga, hope you feel well rested\nGambino stay on, can't nobody pull the cord out\nA nigga fucked up, like a hang gliding whore house\nSick boy, yeah, the clique on deck\nYes, I rap absurd, got the game upset\nAnd they rap about the jewelry, the weed they smoke\nAnd I rap about my life, and niggas think it's a joke, nah\nI only put real on a nigga\nBitches see the money, try and steal on a nigga\nYes, I'm on fire, you can feel it on a nigga\nStep away from the heat; they Shaquillin' on a nigga\nTreat niggas like pussy, go hard on 'em\nWatch the swagga get swiped like a card, bottom\nThe swag's unique, I don't even worry 'bout 'em\nI got the tortoise shell frames and the argyle\nYou wouldn't think from the things I'm fashionin'\nI'd get more bush than Kim Kardashian\nDrop hot shit, yeah, my mouth's a laxative\nBorn to be the greatest, this is not by accident\n\nHey player, what's good?\n(Let me dope you!)\nHey hater, what's hood?\n(Let me dope you!)\nI'm on fire like wood\n(Let me dope you!)\nAnd you don't wanna fuck with dude\n(Let me dope you!)\n\nDon't start no shit, there won't be no shit\nDon't start no shit, there won't be no shit\nDon't start no shit, there won't be no shit\nDon't start no shit, there won't be no shit\n\nI'm a genius, I ain't gotta fake shit\nMy cup runeth over, you can take sips\nI'm in a spa, white robe like a racist\nNiggas can't see me, I will pay for your LASIK\nBuck what ya heard, bitch, I'm flyer than you ever seen\nMy wallet make paper, call it Evergreen\nAshy to classy, finally got some Vaseline\nLive inside a sauna 'cause I always got my self-esteem\nName in your mouth, and it seems as though I struck a nerve\nI never fit in like my penis in these tiny girls\nI figured I was different from these other guys\nWhen I wrote for 30 Rock, I was under 25\nThese other rappers wanna fade into the background\nI'ma stand out when these niggas done sat down\nI always pack heat, yeah, my mouth need a pat down\nMoney, girls, clothes, I don't worry about that now\n\nHey player, what's good?\n(Let me dope you!)\nHey hater, what's hood?\n(Let me dope you!)\nI'm on fire like wood\n(Let me dope you!)\nAnd you don't wanna fuck with dude\n(Let me dope you!)\n\nDon't start no shit, there won't be no shit\nDon't start no shit, there won't be no shit\nDon't start no shit, there won't be no shit\nDon't start no shit, there won't be no shit"}}, {"title": "Do Ya Like", "album": "Culdesac", "year": "2010-07-03", "lyrics": "Words that I made up, you say my name like-\nWords that I made

there ain't sleep in my schedule\nHaving nightmares that I'm the black Heath Ledger\nSleep when I'm dead, these voices in my head\nGot me waking up at 4 just so I can write instead\nAnd my friends come and ask me if it's worth it\nI tell them that \"It better be, I did this shit on purpose!\"\nThe worst is being worthless, now a nigga priceless\nBloomingdale's coat, I don't have to check the prices\nBut I only go to feel a sense of control\n'Cause I get this shit for free if I wear promotional\nAnd I'm not emotional when I do my work\nI get emotional when I order that dessert\n'Cause she always ate dessert\nAnd I deserted her\nBut I refuse to compromise career for a girl\n'Cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul\nAnd if I let it go, there'd be no one left to know\nBeing happy is the goal, but greatness is my vision\nAnd all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition\nBut, baby, I am different\nThis shit is my life\nAnd if you don't believe me, you can never be wife\nI'm walking in this darkness and I'm tryna find a light\nAnd I'd rather die than be average and chances are I might, because\n\nThings are changing, my life's gone pecans\nThirteen cities in the last eight weekends\nAll I know is baby I'm so tired\nRecord on Monday, tape on Tuesday\nI ain't slowing down, I don't care what you say\nFuck this health thing, mama

my schedule\nHaving nightmares that I'm the black Heath Ledger\nSleep when I'm dead, these voices in my head\nGot me waking up at 4 just so I can write instead\nAnd my friends come and ask me if it's worth it\nI tell them that \"It better be, I did this shit on purpose!\"\nThe worst is being worthless, now a nigga priceless\nBloomingdale's coat, I don't have to check the prices\nBut I only go to feel a sense of control\n'Cause I get this shit for free if I wear promotional\nAnd I'm not emotional when I do my work\nI get emotional when I order that dessert\n'Cause she always ate dessert\nAnd I deserted her\nBut I refuse to compromise career for a girl\n'Cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul\nAnd if I let it go, there'd be no one left to know\nBeing happy is the goal, but greatness is my vision\nAnd all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition\nBut, baby, I am different\nThis shit is my life\nAnd if you don't believe me, you can never be wife\nI'm walking in this darkness and I'm tryna find a light\nAnd I'd rather die than be average and chances are I might, because\n\nThings are changing, my life's gone pecans\nThirteen cities in the last eight weekends\nAll I know is baby I'm so tired\nRecord on Monday, tape on Tuesday\nI ain't slowing down, I don't care what you say\nFuck this health thing, mama I'm alright"}}, {"title": "Glory",

alcohol\nYou ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all\n\nTell em what it is, I'm takin great strides\nHood niggas, hipsters, I ain't trying to take sides\nEx-Girlfriend on my mind, she really fucked me up\nDoing shots of whiskey 'till my friends are saying thats enough\nI really really miss her, sometimes I wanna fuck it all\nMix some warm Guinness with 20 tablets of tylenol\nCall 'em while I'm drifting off, tell her that I love her so\nParents crying harder cause I didn't even leave a note\nSaying that I'm selfish and I'm sorry that I left\nBut it hurts so much to wake up and I left you guys a check\nCause I ain't fucking happy, you don't know shit about me\nI think it started when she said she happier without me\nI really can't blame her cause I'm happier without me\nI don't see what girls are seeing when they say they're all about me\nI'm scared they wanna trap me, these all hoes are all liars\nI double bag my shit and never cum while I'm inside her\nI used to be a sweet dude, now I'm so angry\nLook at what these girls and these fake niggas made me\nCry when I'm writing, I don't really know why\nI think its cause I can't really see myself an old guy\nAnd that scares me, I wanna be around a while\nBut I feel my purpose goes beyond having raised a child\nBright lights, they tend to burn out fast\nSo I shine bright, But I'm scared that it won't last\n\nI ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all\nSeeing all this pussy, Imma fuck it all\nFly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol\nYou ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all\nI ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all\nSeeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all\nFly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol\nYou ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all\n\nI'm just about the pop, the industry just noticed it\nPeople watching me, I feel like Amber Rose's tits\nFriends of mine are over it, people say I changed\nAnd I tell them that I'm glad, cause I don't wanna stay the same\nCause I used to be poor, I used to be unconfident\nI used to hate these haters, now its just the opposite\nNot only have I changed, I'm becoming something better\nAnd revenge is for the weak, so I have settled my vendettas\nWith all of the kids who made my early life a living hell\nAnd I hope you're doing well and feeling better 'bout yourself\nDon't know if you can tell, but change is usually for the better\nI used to like these bitches but couldn't afford to get em\nBut now I'll take your girl, yeah player pay homage\nThat's why I fuck these bad mamas, Kate Gosselin\nI'm trying to tell the world I'm nothing to be trifled with\nDonald Glover staying hotter than some rifle spit\nThey only wanna fuck with you after you made your way\nBut when you started out you couldn't pay em to stay\nBut now I got em lined up in the lobby door\nIt makes me wonder what this rapping shit's a hobby for\nOh thats right, because I'm gifted in another field, and another field, and another field\nThey say my public persona don't have enough appeal\nI take a lesson from Kanye and give em something real\nI'm getting all this attention I wanna do it right\nThat's why I'm performing for you like every single night\nTo all my fans who's saying Donald Glover about to blow\nJust give me six months so you can say I told you so\n\nI ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all\nSeeing all

drinking alcohol\nYou ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all\nI ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all\nSeeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all\nFly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol\nYou ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all\n\nTell em what it is, I'm takin great strides\nHood niggas, hipsters, I ain't trying to take sides\nEx-Girlfriend on my mind, she really fucked me up\nDoing shots of whiskey 'till my friends are saying thats enough\nI really really miss her, sometimes I wanna fuck it all\nMix some warm Guinness with 20 tablets of tylenol\nCall 'em while I'm drifting off, tell her that I love her so\nParents crying harder cause I didn't even leave a note\nSaying that I'm selfish and I'm sorry that I left\nBut it hurts so much to wake up and I left you guys a check\nCause I ain't fucking happy, you don't know shit about me\nI think it started when she said she happier without me\nI really can't blame her cause I'm happier without me\nI don't see what girls are seeing when they say they're all about me\nI'm scared they wanna trap me, these all hoes are all liars\nI double bag my shit and never cum while I'm inside her\nI used to be a sweet dude, now I'm so angry\nLook at what these girls and these fake niggas made me\nCry when I'm writing, I don't really know why\nI think its cause I can't really see myself an old guy\nAnd that scares me, I wanna be around a while\nBut I feel my purpose goes beyond having raised a child\nBright lights, they tend to burn out fast\nSo I shine bright, But I'm scared that it won't last\n\nI ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all\nSeeing all this pussy, Imma fuck it all\nFly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol\nYou ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all\nI ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all\nSeeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all\nFly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol\nYou ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all\n\nI'm just about the pop, the industry just noticed it\nPeople watching me, I feel like Amber Rose's tits\nFriends of mine are over it, people say I changed\nAnd I tell them that I'm glad, cause I don't wanna stay the same\nCause I used to be poor, I used to be unconfident\nI used to hate these haters, now its just the opposite\nNot only have I changed, I'm becoming something better\nAnd revenge is for the weak, so I have settled my vendettas\nWith all of the kids who made my early life a living hell\nAnd I hope you're doing well and feeling better 'bout yourself\nDon't know if you can tell, but change is usually for the better\nI used to like these bitches but couldn't afford to get em\nBut now I'll take your girl, yeah player pay homage\nThat's why I fuck these bad mamas, Kate Gosselin\nI'm trying to tell the world I'm nothing to be trifled with\nDonald Glover staying hotter than some rifle spit\nThey only wanna fuck with you after you made your way\nBut when you started out you couldn't pay em to stay\nBut now I got em lined up in the lobby door\nIt makes me wonder what this rapping shit's a hobby for\nOh thats right, because I'm gifted in another field, and another field, and another field\nThey say my public persona don't have enough appeal\nI take a lesson from Kanye and give em something real\nI'm getting all this attention I wanna do it right\nThat's why I'm performing for you like every single night\nTo all my fans who's saying Donald Glover about to blow\nJust give me six months so you can say I told you so\n\nI ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all\nSeeing all this pussy, Imma fuck it all\nFly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol\nYou ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all\nI ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all\nSeeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all\nFly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol\nYou ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all"}}, {"title": "I\u2019m On It", "album": "Culdesac", "year": "2010-07-03",

killer\nI gotta stay sick, I'd be dead if I was iller\nIs it weird going hard when these niggas goin' pillow?\nYep, my life is great, I changed my stars\nI re-arrange fate when I rap on bars\nCheezy in the building, hope you niggas missed me\nChilling with these bitches, got my nigga feeling tipsy\nHaters mean mugging, face is sour like my whiskey\nI don't need a chaser, tell that liquor come and get me\nWho'd have thought this rapping make sense, no 50?\nAnd if you're doing great like I am, Say it with me\n\nYes, I'm on it, I'm so on it\nYes, I'm on it, I'm so on it\nYes, I'm on it, I'm so on

NYU, looking for a dollar\nToo proud to ask my friends or my struggling father\nSo I skate around the city for a couple hours\nDreaming up a day that I could say this world is ours\nNow I got some, but I want it all\nAnd I won't stop until Rihanna gives my ass a call\nAnd I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol\nCause this shit hurts, call it the uncle curse\nBut I'm living for the moment, not the long haul\nAnd I refuse to slow down until its last call\nErykah keeps telling me to grow a conscience\nAnd treat women like money, no object\nBut these hoes are a much different story\nStraight laced chicks don't do nothing for me\nI'm in a weird place, I got a little money\nBut money won't buy you time, If all the time is running from me\nThere's so much I wanna do, like write a script or write a book\nGet an hour on HBO, and date a girl who likes to cook\nAnd stop having all of these crushes on all of my friends girlfriends\nI think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends\nIt looks nice, I gotta get me one of those\nI haven't found Mrs. Right, but I'm On it though\nYeah I'm on it though", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c1ef4069c4c1c948f7d4a700c4be323.555x555x1.jpg",

on it, I'm so on it\nYes, I'm on it, I'm so on it\nOh, oh, oh\n\nOkay, one for the money, two for the money\nI used to write jokes, ain't this shit funny?\nModels on me, yes these girls crazy\nGotta take advantage, that is what the fans made me\nShine on these niggas, how these niggas stay shady?\nAnd if you don't see me, you are not star gazing\nPlay my cards right, I may never meet the dealer\nAnd yes I'm in the building like a horror movie killer\nI gotta stay sick, I'd be dead if I was iller\nIs it weird going hard when these niggas goin' pillow?\nYep, my life is great, I changed my stars\nI re-arrange fate when I rap on bars\nCheezy in the building, hope you niggas missed me\nChilling with these bitches, got my nigga feeling tipsy\nHaters mean mugging, face is sour like my whiskey\nI don't need a chaser, tell that liquor come and get me\nWho'd have thought this rapping make sense, no 50?\nAnd if you're doing great like I am, Say it with me\n\nYes, I'm on it, I'm so on it\nYes, I'm on it, I'm so on it\nYes, I'm on it, I'm so on it\nYes, I'm on it, I'm so on it\nYes, I'm on it, I'm so on it\nYes, I'm on it, I'm so on it\nOh, oh, oh\n\nYeah, I used to be broke, no cash\nAnd them niggas played games, Road Rash\nWalking 'round NYU, looking for a dollar\nToo proud to ask my friends or my struggling father\nSo I skate around the city for a couple hours\nDreaming up a day that I could say this world is ours\nNow I got some, but I want it all\nAnd I won't stop until Rihanna gives my ass a call\nAnd I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol\nCause this shit hurts, call it the uncle curse\nBut I'm living for the moment, not the long haul\nAnd I refuse to slow down until its last call\nErykah keeps telling me to grow a conscience\nAnd treat women like money, no object\nBut these hoes are a much different story\nStraight laced chicks don't do nothing for me\nI'm in a weird place, I got a little money\nBut money won't buy you time, If all the time is running from me\nThere's so much I wanna do, like write a script or write a book\nGet an hour on HBO, and date a girl who likes to cook\nAnd stop having all of these crushes on all of my friends girlfriends\nI think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends\nIt looks nice, I gotta get me one of those\nI haven't found Mrs. Right, but I'm On it though\nYeah I'm on it though"}}, {"title":

hang with Lil Wayne, I just hope that I'm black enough\nDamn, I guess we're all friends here\nExcept for I don't know you, like you was me last year\nIt's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends\nI wanna fuck these small girls, minus \"S-M\"\nMeaning that I fuck all girls, that is wordplay\nCatch me on my iPhone doing what the birds say\nI ain't going nowhere, somebody better tell a hater\nHe's goin' down like my living room elevator\nFuck what you heard, bitch, I'll fuck your fuckin' brains out\nAnd make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out\nPut your

fuckin' with a wide receiver\nI'm a genius, and I ain't try to hide it either\nGot a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight\nMixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite\nBaby

girls, you can put in my video\nThick girls, you can put it in my video\nThin girls, you can put in my video\nSmarty art chicks, you can put it my video\nDumb hoes, you can put it in my video\nSmooth girls, you can put it in my video\nNerd girls, you can put it in my video\n\nI'm blowing up like my swagger on the Gaza\nI'm writing movies where I'm making out with Aubrey Plaza\nAnd homegirl my homegirl, it is not like that\nBut if she tried to rape me, I would not fight back\nGirls who turned me down are saying \"please\" and \"sorry\"\nYou lucky that I'm Randy, Aziz Ansari\nSo now I'm in the club tellin' strippers they should back it up\nI wanna hang with Lil Wayne, I just hope that I'm black enough\nDamn, I guess we're all friends here\nExcept for I don't know you, like you was me last year\nIt's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends\nI wanna fuck these small girls, minus \"S-M\"\nMeaning that I fuck all girls, that is wordplay\nCatch me on my iPhone doing what the birds say\nI ain't going nowhere, somebody better tell a hater\nHe's goin' down like my living room elevator\nFuck what you heard, bitch, I'll fuck your fuckin' brains out\nAnd make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out\nPut your fucking boots on, it's time to kick the lames out\nYou got your favorite rapper in your ear, it's time to change out\n\nLight-skinned girls, you can put it in my video\nDark-skinned girls, you can put in my video\nThick girls, you can put it in my video\nThin girls, you can put in my video\nSmarty art chicks, you can put it my video\nDumb hoes, you can put it in my video\nSmooth girls, you can put it in my video\nNerd girls, you can put it in my video\n\nWatch your girlfriend, I'll fuck her then I up and leave her\nGirls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber\nPussy thrown at me, you fuckin' with a wide receiver\nI'm a genius, and I ain't try to hide it either\nGot a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight\nMixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite\nBaby girl, shorty, have it however you want it\nWhatever you asking 'bout, I promise you that I done it\nMy swagger's New York but my home is the South\nAnd it's amazing how I eat more pussy than Alf\nAnd I'm all up in your ear but then I'm all in your mouth\nI don't talk, but girls the only thing we're talkin' about\n\nLight-skinned girls, you can put it in my video\nDark-skinned girls, you can put in my video\nThick girls, you can put it in my video\nThin girls, you can put in my video\nSmarty art chicks, you can put it my video\nDumb hoes, you can put it in my video\nSmooth girls, you can put it in my video\nNerd girls, you can put it in my video\n\nPut, put it in my video\nPut, put, put, put it in my video"}}, {"title": "These

my apartment's pretty close\nBaby, let me make you breakfast, an omelet with some toast\nThese girls are on my mind, wasn't my design\nTo be sitting here across from you, pretending I ain't lyin'\nI know exactly how you feel, I wanna keep it real\nI never thought that I'd be working for the start cause\n\nThese girls have all the best of me\nI bet that I will lose it all\nThese girls have all the best of me\nI bet that I will lose it all\nI know this thing will never last\nI need to tear it all apart\nThese girls have all the best of me\nI bet that I can lose it all\n\nI don't have the heart, fuck it, I don't have the head\nEvery time that we're apart, someone's sleeping in my bed\nI wanna be alone, I wanna be alone\nThis fame and fortune shit shows me things I wasn't knownin'\nYou're my biggest fan, I promise to be there\nI wanna be that guy, but I don't think I can\nI'm losing everything, I wanna let it go\nI wanna take it right and slow because\n\nThese girls have all the best of me\nI bet that I will lose it all\nThese girls have all the best of me\nI bet that I will lose it all\nI know this thing will never last\nI need to tear it all apart\nThese girls have all the best of

thing\nCan't see me, best to get yourself some Visine\nToe tag a motherfucker\nNo jokes while these other niggas \"wakka wakka\"\nOther rappers try and go and get over\nYou want that hood shit? Best to go and call Hova\nI was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder\n98 test score in my ThunderCat folder\nMy cousin was older, my mama used to wake up\nDrive me to his school 'cause his school was much safer\nBut I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher\nNow I'm going to a school where I get beat up\nBecause I ain't get down with them other kids\nProbably 'cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there\nMama couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there\nGuest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom\nNow I'm going to this school called Rockbridge\nSchool of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in\nThere's not a lot of black kids\nSo I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne\nBut really what I wanna know is why I never fit in right\nLike a fat dude getting on a packed flight\nEven when I make friends in the hallways\nI'm wishing I was someone else always\nBut I'm happy that that shit happened to me\n'Cause it taught me most important is to do me\n'Cause everybody hates you till they love you\nFacebook niggas same niggas that would shove you\n'Cause nobody was jocking my style\n'Cause I had a high voice, they called me faggot 8 Mile\nSo I stopped writing for a very long time\nThinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes\nAnd this next part, sounds like nonsense\nBut I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence\nTaught me everything that is good comes from honesty\nEverybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it\nShe on her role model shit\nFrom the day that I shook her hand\nI knew that I'd never die a broke man\nSo I could try this rapping shit out again\nThe game need change, I'm a part of it\nPeople tell me I should spit under Donald Glover\nBut I try to keep my real name undercover\n'Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes\nAnd I can't go for that, nigga; Hall and Oates\nMy nigga stay down like a winter coat\nI rap about my life, not \"I'm On a Boat\"\n'Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand\nOnly ones who do it well's Lonely Island\nSave the raps about your cat, I am not a fan\nLeave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here\nI do not play around with this bullshit\nI am different, call it new shit\nLabels want me to hurry and cash my check in\nBut I keep my shit free till the last possible second\n'Cause God knows that I don't need the money\nYou get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?\nBut this limelight burn like a motherfuck\nI wanna call my dad crying but I hang up\n'Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit\nSo I send him a check and tell him to hold it\nIf anything ever happens, want you to know this\nI always took the time to smell the roses\nAnd wherever I am, I am doing fine\nI'm here for a good, not a long, time",

Best to go and call Hova\nI was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder\n98 test score in my ThunderCat folder\nMy cousin was older, my mama used to wake up\nDrive me to his school 'cause his school was much safer\nBut I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher\nNow I'm going to a school where I get beat up\nBecause I ain't get down with them other kids\nProbably 'cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there\nMama couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there\nGuest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom\nNow I'm going to this school called Rockbridge\nSchool of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in\nThere's not a lot of black kids\nSo I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne\nBut really what I wanna know is why I never fit in right\nLike a fat dude getting on a packed flight\nEven when I make friends in the hallways\nI'm wishing I was someone else always\nBut I'm happy that that shit happened to me\n'Cause it taught me most important is to do me\n'Cause everybody hates you till they love you\nFacebook niggas same niggas that would shove you\n'Cause nobody was jocking my style\n'Cause I had a high voice, they called me faggot 8 Mile\nSo I stopped writing for a very long time\nThinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes\nAnd this next part, sounds like nonsense\nBut I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence\nTaught me everything that is good comes from honesty\nEverybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it\nShe on her role model shit\nFrom the day that I shook her hand\nI knew that I'd never die a broke man\nSo I could try this rapping shit out again\nThe game need change, I'm a part of it\nPeople tell me I should spit under Donald Glover\nBut I try to keep my real name undercover\n'Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes\nAnd I can't go for that, nigga; Hall and Oates\nMy nigga stay down like a winter coat\nI rap about my life, not \"I'm On a Boat\"\n'Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand\nOnly ones who do it well's Lonely Island\nSave the raps about your cat, I am not a fan\nLeave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here\nI do not play around with this bullshit\nI am different, call it new shit\nLabels want me to hurry and cash my check in\nBut I keep my shit free till the last possible second\n'Cause God knows that I don't need the money\nYou get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?\nBut this limelight burn like a motherfuck\nI wanna call my dad crying but I hang up\n'Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit\nSo I send him a check and tell him to hold it\nIf anything ever happens, want you to know this\nI always took the time to smell the roses\nAnd wherever I am, I am doing fine\nI'm here for a good, not a long, time"}}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
