la-la-la-la-la, oh\n(This feeling's like... so real) Oh, oh\n\nI'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up\nAnd I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough\nYou got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue\n'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you\nI'm the question and you're of course the answer\nJust hold me close boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer\nYou make me shaken, I'm never mistaken\nBut I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help\n\nS-O-S, please someone help me\nIt's not healthy for me to feel this\nY-O-U are makin' this hard\nI can't take it, see, it don't feel right\nS-O-S, please someone help me\nIt's not healthy for me to feel this\nY-O-U are makin' this hard\nYou got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night\n\nThis time please, someone come and rescue me\n'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it\nI'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me\nLove is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it\nThis time please, someone come and rescue me\n'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it\nI'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me\nGot the best of me, so now I'm losin' it\n\nJust your presence and I second guess my sanity\nYes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity\nMy tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot\nMy common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock\nTake on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right\nTake me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight\nI melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)\nBoy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel\n\nS-O-S, please someone help me\nIt's not healthy for me to feel this\nY-O-U are makin' this hard (Y-O-U are)\nYou got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night\n\nThis time please, someone come and rescue me\n'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it ('Cause you on my mind)\nI'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me\nLove is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it\nThis time please, someone come and rescue me (Someone come and rescue me)\n'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it\nI'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me\nGot the best of me, so now I'm losin' it\n\nBoy, you know you got me feelin' open\nAnd boy, your love's enough with words unspoken\nI said boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open\nI don't know what to do, it's true\nI'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'\n\nS-O-S, please someone help me\nIt's not healthy for me to feel this\nY-O-U are makin' this hard (Why you makin' this hard for me, baby?)\nYou got me tossing and turning, can't sleep at night\nThis time please, someone come and rescue me (Someone rescue me)\n'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it\nI'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me\nLove is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it\n\nThis time please, someone come and rescue me\n'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it (All of the time)\nI'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me\nGot the best of me, so now I'm losin' it (Best of me, I'm losin' it )\n\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh\nOh, oh\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh\nOh, oh", "image":

man, and this is more than love\nThe reason that the sky is blue\nThe clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again\nAnd to him, I just can't be true\n\nAnd I know that he knows I'm unfaithful\nAnd it kills him inside\nTo know that I am happy with some other guy\nI can see him dying\n\nI don't wanna do this anymore\nI don't wanna be the reason why\nEvery time I walk out the door\nI see him die a little more inside\nI don't wanna hurt him anymore\nI don't wanna take away his life\nI don't wanna be a murderer\n\nI feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair\nPreparing for another date\nA kiss upon my cheek\nAs he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late\nI say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls\nA lie I didn't have to tell\nBecause we both know where I'm about to go\nAnd we know it very well\n\n'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful\nAnd it kills him inside\nTo know that I am happy with some other guy\nI can see him dying\n\nI don't wanna do this anymore\nI don't wanna be

love\nThe reason that the sky is blue\nThe clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again\nAnd to him, I just can't be true\n\nAnd I know that he knows I'm unfaithful\nAnd it kills him inside\nTo know that I am happy with some other guy\nI can see him dying\n\nI don't wanna do this anymore\nI don't wanna be the reason why\nEvery time I walk out the door\nI see him die a little more inside\nI don't wanna hurt him anymore\nI don't wanna take away his life\nI don't wanna be a murderer\n\nI feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair\nPreparing for another date\nA kiss upon my cheek\nAs he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late\nI say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls\nA lie I didn't have to tell\nBecause we both know where I'm about to go\nAnd we know it very well\n\n'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful\nAnd it kills him inside\nTo know that I am happy with some other guy\nI can see him dying\n\nI don't wanna do this anymore\nI don't wanna be the reason why\nEvery time I walk out the door\nI see him die a little more inside\nI don't wanna hurt him anymore\nI don't wanna take away his life\nI don't wanna be a murderer\n\nOur love, his trust\nI might as well take a gun and put it to his head\nGet it over with\nI don't wanna do this anymore\nWhoa\nAnymore\n\nI don't wanna do this anymore\nI don't wanna be the reason why\nAnd every time I walk out the door\nI see him die a little more inside\nAnd I don't wanna hurt him anymore\nI don't wanna take away his life\nI don't wanna be, a murderer\n\nA murderer, no, no, no\nYeah"}}, {"title": "We Ride", "album": "A Girl

sent\nYou had me thinking you were out wit' your friends\nI'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid\n'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh\n\nNow I look back on the time that we spent\nAnd I see it in my mind playin' over and over again\n'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down\nAnd I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said\n\nWe ride\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\n'Til we die\nYou used to say, \"When we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die.\"\nWe ride\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\n'Til we die\nBut I remember what you used to say\n\"When we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die.\"\n\nVisions in my mind of the day that we met\nYou showed me things that I'll never forget\nTook me swimming, in the ocean\nYou had my head up in the clouds\nMade me feel like I'm floating, yeah\nYou think I'm playing when you know it's the truth\nNobody else can do it quite like I do\nAll my kisses and my loving\nBut ain't nobody better than us\nYeah, yeah\n\nNow I look back on the time that we spent\nAnd I see it in my mind playin' over and over again\n'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking

indefinitely\nBut you and I know it\u2019s not that easy to let go\nOf everything, that we planned\nAnd start all over again, hey\nJust blame yourself 'cause you blew it\nI won\u2019t forget how you do it\nMy sweet baby, this is where the game ends now\nSomehow\nWanna believe you and me, we can figure it out, oh\n\nRide\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\nTil we die\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\n\nGonna make me say, boy\nI wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely\nWhen I need someone to talk to, you would phone me\nJust like everything you told me\n(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)\nBoy, you forgot about the promises you made me\nAnd now we'll let the memories just fade away\nBut I remember what you used to say\n(When we

ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\n\nIt's real late, 'bout a quarter to one\nI'm thinking about everything that we've become, and I hate it\nI thought we could make it, but I'm ready to dead this\nJust wanna forget about it\nI saw her pictures and the letters she sent\nYou had me thinking you were out wit' your friends\nI'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid\n'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh\n\nNow I look back on the time that we spent\nAnd I see it in my mind playin' over and over again\n'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down\nAnd I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said\n\nWe ride\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\n'Til we die\nYou used to say, \"When we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die.\"\nWe ride\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\n'Til we die\nBut I remember what you used to say\n\"When we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die.\"\n\nVisions in my mind of the day that we met\nYou showed me things that I'll never forget\nTook me swimming, in the ocean\nYou had my head up in the clouds\nMade me feel like I'm floating, yeah\nYou think I'm playing when you know it's the truth\nNobody else can do it quite like I do\nAll my kisses and my loving\nBut ain't nobody better than us\nYeah, yeah\n\nNow I look back on the time that we spent\nAnd I see it in my mind playin' over and over again\n'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down\nAnd I just can't figure out why, but you said\n\nWe ride\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\n'Til we die\nYou used to say, \"When we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die.\"\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\n'Til we die\nBut I remember what you used to say\n\"When we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die.\"\n\nI guess it\u2019s over indefinitely\nBut you and I know it\u2019s not that easy to let go\nOf everything, that we planned\nAnd start all over again, hey\nJust blame yourself 'cause you blew it\nI won\u2019t forget how you do it\nMy sweet baby, this is where the game ends now\nSomehow\nWanna believe you and me, we can figure it out, oh\n\nRide\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\nTil we die\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\n\nGonna make me say, boy\nI wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely\nWhen I need someone to talk to, you would phone me\nJust like everything you told me\n(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)\nBoy, you forgot about the promises you made me\nAnd now we'll let the memories just fade away\nBut I remember what you used to say\n(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)\n\nWe ride\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die\n'Til we die\nYou used to say, \"When we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til the day that we die.\"\nWhen we ride, we ride\nWhen we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til we die\nBut I remember what you used to say\n\"When we ride, we ride\nIt's 'til

the lights and close our eyes\nI'll tell you a secret I've held all my life\nIt's you that I live for, and for you, I die\nSo I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye\n\nHold, draw me close, close to my lips\nListen intently as I tell you this\nOutside the world wages its wars\nI'll rest in peace as long as you know\n\nBefore we turn out the lights and close our eyes\nI'll tell you a secret I've held all my life\nIt's you that I live for, and for you, I die\nSo I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye\n\nPromise you our love will carry on\nUntil you turn eternal, we belong\n\nBefore we turn out the lights and close our eyes\nI'll tell you a secret I've held all my life\nIt's you that I live for, and for you, I die\nSo I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye\nHis respectful lips for the last time\nAnd spell out the lyrics to love in the sky\nIt's you that I live for, and for you, I die\nSo I'll lay here with you\n'Til the final

this the way that it supposed to be when I look into your eyes?\nAll you have to do is say my name\nJust a stutter, more like butter\nSince I met you, boy, my whole worlds changed\nI can't hide this or deny this\n\nBoy, you got me catching feelings\nGot me thinking maybe you're the one\nI didn't understand the reason\nThat my heart was beating like a drum\nI didn't understand the meaning\nThen you opened up my eyes to\nA crazy little thing called love\n(A crazy little thing called love)\nA crazy little thing called love\n(Whoa, yeah!)\n\nMy best friends tell me \"Rihanna, what's got into you?\"\nI said \"LeAndra, I can't explain these feelings I'm going through\"\nThey tell me \"Girl, it's not like you to fall this way\"\nI try my best to wear a disguise, but it's written on my face\n\nBoy, you got me catching feelings\nGot me thinking maybe you're the one (maybe you're the one)\nI didn't understand the reason\nThat my heart was beating like a drum\nI didn't understand the meaning\nThen you opened up my eyes to\nA crazy little thing called love\n(A crazy little thing called love)\nA crazy little thing called love\n(A crazy crazy little thing called love)\n(Whoa, yeah!)\n\nGirl, it's crazy It's amazing\nIt's the loving that you feeling\nPut a tingle in your body every time you want a healing\nHey Rihanna\nBaby girl, for you missing the song, yeah\nSo tell the DJ put the pon de replay\nIf you wanna\nCome on my bajun, baby\nLet me take to Jamaica\nAnd introduce you to the real thing\nFor the loving where you are\nSo baby you're my number 1, not number 2\nSo if its lovin' that you want\nBaby, you should make me your boo\n\nBoy, you got me catching feelings (Boy, you got me)\nGot me thinking maybe you're the one (Maybe you're the one)\nI didn't understand the reason\nThat my heart was beating like a drum (Beating like a drum)\nI didn't understand the meaning\nThen you opened up my eyes to\nA crazy little thing called love (Crazy, crazy, baby, baby)\n(A crazy little thing called love)\nA crazy little thing called love\n(Whoa, yeah!)\n\nDon't understand the meaning\nThis means crazy, baby\nI try my best not to show\nBut you know it's so crazy,

don't care what anybody got to say\nMaybe they never had it quite this way\nLet them talk and criticize\nThey all need to recognize\nThey might see I'm a bit extreme\nTo need you night and day\nWhat I

mind\nI got it bad boy, I can't lie\nI want your time and your full attention\nI wanna to talk to you\nAnd not to mention good love that you give to me\nI think about it constantly\nNo, I won't apologize for feeling like I do\nIt's just the simple facts of life\nI'm crazy over you\n\nI'm a selfish girl when it comes to you\nEvery minute of the day\nI'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy\nIt's killing me\nWhen it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you\nYou might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care\nI need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl\n\nI understand that you got your crew\nBut I've got something in mind for you\nMake you lose all track of time\nGuaranteed to blow your mind\nI don't care what anybody got to say\nMaybe they never had it quite this way\nLet them talk and criticize\nThey all need to recognize\nThey might see I'm a bit extreme\nTo need you night and day\nWhat I feel can't be concealed\nThere ain't no other way\n\nI'm a selfish girl when it comes to you (I'm a selfish girl)\nEvery minute of the day\nI'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy\nIt's killing me\nWhen it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you\n(When it comes to love, I don't share)\nYou might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care\nI need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl\n\nBoy, you got me tripping\nI didn't know what I was missing\nThis is crazy (Crazy)\nSo amazing (So amazing)\nI didn't mean to be demanding, but I hope you're understanding\nI'm not playing, boy (I'm not playing, boy)\nI'm just saying, boy\nThey might seem I'm a bit extreme\nTo need you night and day\nBut what I feel can't be concealed\nThere ain't no other way\n\n(I'm a selfish girl) I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you\nEvery minute of the day (Every day)\nI'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy\nIt's killing me\nWhen it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you\nYou might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care\nI need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl\n(Need you in my world, I'm a selfish girl)\n\nBoy, you got me tripping\nI didn't know what I was missing (Didn't know what I was missing)\nThis is crazy (Crazy)\nSo amazing (So amazing)\nI didn't mean to be

I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know\nWe're just holding onto \"could have been's\" that we should be letting go\n\nIt feels like you're a million miles away\nAs you're lying here with me tonight\nI can't even find the words to say\nI can find a way to make it right\nAnd we both know that the story's ending\nWe play the part, but we're just pretending\nAnd I can't hide the tears\n'Cause even though you're here\nIt feels like you're a million miles away\n\nWas it me, or was it you that broke away?\nWhat we were is like a season, love is change\nAnd every time I think about it\nIt tears me up inside\nLike the rivers of emotion\nBut I got no more tears to cry\n\nIt feels like you're a million miles away\nAs you're lying here with me tonight\nI can't even find the words to say\nI can find a way to make it right\nAnd we both know that the story's ending\nWe play the part, but we're just pretending\nAnd I can't hide the tears\n'Cause even though you're here\nIt feels like you're a million miles away\nAway\n\nWe can try to talk it over\nBut we've walked that road before\nWhile our song is playing its last note\nAnd we both know for sure\nThat it's time to close that door\n\nIt feels like you're a million miles away\nAs you're lying here with me tonight\nI can't even find the words to say\nI can find a way to make it right\nAnd we both know that the story's ending\nWe play the part, but we're just pretending\nAnd I can't hide the tears\n'Cause even though you're here\nIt feels like you're a million miles away\nA million miles away"}}, {"title":

actor on a movie screen\nYou played the part with every line\nWell, every story doesn't have a happy ending\nSometimes a flower doesn't grow\nI hope you understand the message that I'm sending\nBut boy, I think you need to know\n\n(Coulda been the one)\nThat I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo\n(Shoulda been the one)\nDidn't know just what you had, boy\nNow it's just too bad, boy\n(After all is said and done)\nYou're a cheater and a liar\nWent to play with fire\nBoy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun\n'Cause you coulda been the one\nThere's nothing left to say\nCoulda been the one\nCoulda been, shoulda been, baby\n\nMy momma didn't raise no fool\nShe said play with fire, you get burned\nYou laughed at me, I laugh at you\nNow it seems the tables turned\nI must admit, I really thought you had potential\nBut I could not have been more wrong\nI need somebody I can trust with his essentials\nYou had your chance, but now I'm long gone\n\n(Coulda been the one)\nThat I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo\n(Shoulda been the one)\nDidn't know just what you had, boy\nNow it's just too bad, boy\n(After all is said and done)\nYou're a cheater and a liar\nWent to play with fire\nBoy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun\n'Cause you coulda been the one\nCoulda been the one, baby\nCoulda been the one\n\nYou played yourself, boy\nAnd there is no denying it\nIt's just the way the story goes\nYou made your bed, boy\nBetter go and lie in it\nBut know that you'll be lying there alone\n\n(Coulda been the one)\nThat I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo\n(Shoulda been the one)\nDidn't know just what you had, boy\nNow it's just too bad, boy\n(After all is said and done)\nYou're a cheater and a liar\nWent to play with fire\nBoy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun\n'Cause you coulda been the one\nThere's nothing left to say\nCoulda been the one\nCoulda been, shoulda been"}}], "artist": "Rihanna"}
