radio cats, listers or plain ol' haters\nA small piece a my album which is titled Under Construction\nUnder Construction simply states that I'm a work in progress\nI'm working on myself\nYou know uh, every since Aaliyah passed\nI view life in a uh, more valuable way\nLooking at hate and anger and gossip or\nJust plain ol' bullshit became ignorant to me\nWhen you realize in a blink of a eye\nYou walking down a church aisle\nAnd that was meant for weddings and happiness\nAnd realize the same church aisles are used\nTo view a loved one for the last time\nFrom the world trade families the Left Eye family, Big Pun family\nYou know Biggie family, Pac family to the hip hop family\nWe all under construction tryin to rebuild you know ourselves\nHip hop done gained respect from you know...\nNot even respect from but just like rock and roll\nAnd it took us a lot of hard work to get here\nSo all that hate and animosity between folks ya need ta kill it\nWit a skillet\nYou don't see Bill Gates and Donald trump\nArguing wit each other 'cuz both of them got paper\nAnd the they got better shit to do: get mo' paper\nSo all I'm sayin' is, let's take hip hop back to the rope follow me\n(Hard working, the star of the show)\nMisdemeanor here!\n(Hard working, the star of the show)\nMr. Mos' on the beats!\n(Hard working, the star of the show)\n2000 Eternity!!!\n(Hard working, the star of the show)\nI'm the star of the show, let the show begin\n\nThis is a Missy Elliott Exclusive (Set it off)\nMomma say, momma sah, momma can you do this?\nTalkin' like you baddest when you just know dat is\nEvery time I come out ya'll be like who dat is\nBe like more like Ashanti and be unfoolish\nYou don't really want to break it wit me\nYou wear Gata I sport the Fendi\nMy Lamborghini against you Benzi\nDirty diamonds and your ring see mine like cling cling cling\nDing ding ding ding ding ding da ding ding\nI used to get so high they call me Ming Lee\nSpiked up my hair done like Don King\nHaters keep on hatin' 'cause dem don't worry we\nDem don't worry we or me and Timothy\nM I S E slimed out my bodee-ee-ee\nBang bang to the boogie ooh, wee\nPlaya keep on playin' watch me do my duty\n\nGo to the floor (now tell me what you want)\nGrab me a drink (now what you gon'do)\nI came to shake, shake my booty down down to the beat\nStand on the chairs (and dance like who?)\nDance like the freaks (now what you came to do?)\nI came to shake shake my booty down, hype the party (Set it off)\n\nI'm underrated, glad I made it, independent operated\nI never hesitated, haters keep me motivated\nThe beat is penetrated I'll let Timmy regulate it\nAnd we laid it in the shade and drink a glass of lemonade n\nDamn I'm faded!\nAin't no other way to say it ain't that complicated\nAin't no other chicks gon' ever make me feel like invaded\nI keep droppin' hits like water breakin'\nTwo centimeters and I'm dialatin'\nRadio impatient, pause, come on, check my translation\nFrom my observation my fans is real patient\nThey don't wanna hear the lies so stop fakin'\nYou're greasy like bacon, keep my stomach achin'\nIf you wanna battle let there be no more delayin'\nI hope you did some prayin' 'cause when I come swayin'\nPop shu pop, pop, pop, yeah\nSometimes I flow sometimes quick\nYou was on the verge of kissin' ass so slick\nI'd be on the verge or makin' hits after hits\nThis the kind of shit that tell yo mammy don't forget\n\nGo to the floor (now tell me what you want)\nGrab me a drink (now what you gon'do)\nI came to shake, shake my booty down down to the beat\nStand on the chairs (and dance like who?)\nDance like the freaks (now what you came to do?)\nI came to shake shake my booty down, hype the party (Ohh)\n\nEverybody, move your body now do it\nHere's somethin' that's gonna make you move and goove\n(New Missy Elliott y'all!)\nHey DJ keep playin' that song all night, on and on and on\nIs the niggas over there, bitches rightchea\nYea yea yea yea yea yea yea jeyah\nAll night long I hope you all came prepared\nIt's five o'clock and we ain't goin' nowhere\nOh yeah, oh, ooh wee\nAnd will the guy the cash choose me? (Oh yeah!)\nBaby, I got a man I ain't seen lately (Go down to the floor)\n\nGo to the floor (now tell me what you want)\nGrab me a drink (now what you gon'do)\nI came to shake, shake my booty down down to the beat\nStand on the chairs (and dance like who?)\nDance like the freaks (now what you came to do?)\nI came to shake shake my booty down, hype the party"}}, {"title": "Bring the Pain", "album": "Under Construction", "year": "2002-11-12", "lyrics": "\"One two three four five six seven eight nine!\" - Chuck D\n\"Are we on the air?\"\n\nUhh, uhh ..

Benz\nAnd don't I gotta look sweet for my mens\nAnd make 'em think I got a whole bunch of paper\nAnd even date a ball player from the Lakers\nNow fake a take and make 'em holler at cha later\nShake em Wake em and tell 'em what to get my ass from Jacob's\nThat's the way a real diva like to floss it\nBuy a car no matter what is costs\nOf course my Rolls Royces make 'em nauseous\nTell you who the motherfucking boss is\nI'm driving, you walking that's why you talking\nSee the chrome spinning on the wheels stop jocking\nI`mma let you know real nice and slow\nI'd be broke as a joke if I had to be a ho\nSo poor, Missy on the rise like the sun\nIf you think that I`m done, I ain`t even begun\n\nSlide, Slide, Dip, Dip, Shake\nMove it all around, Move it all around\nSlide, Slide, Dip, Dip, Shake\nMove it all around, Move it all around\n\nFeel the boombastic in ya back head\n15\"s putting holes in ya back head\nBbboomp bbboomp bbboomb bbboomb\nDon't it sound so fantastic\nMy Lamborghini disappear like Houdini\nTwo-Twenty can't see me in the bottle like a Genie\nTeeny, Weeny, now hate me like you hate to eat your Wheaties\nNow here's a freebie, I`mma let you see me on T.V\nAccepting my Emmy on a Grammy in Miami\nI hit you with the one, two, whammy\nYou no tooth granny, with a hole in her panties\nAnd I don't give a shit if you can't stand me\nCause I is what I is, and what I am is like my Mammy\nAnd I don't mean to sound too petty\nBut they use to call me Fatty until I got with Puff Daddy\n\nSlide, Slide, Dip, Dip, Shake\nMove it all around, Move it all around\nSlide, Slide, Dip, Dip, Shake\nMove it all around, Move it all around\n\nMy rims keep turnin' and turnin'\nTires burnin' through Queens and Mount Vernon\nAnd yes it's my concern that:\nYour chain Platinum or is it really Sterling?\nI'm old school I rock a Sherlin\nFrom New Jers heard all the way to Berlin\nAnd that's for certain\nBehind every curtain is a snake bitch lurking and she about to catch a hurtin\nMr. Moes on the beats, and Missy be the beats behind the beats\nMy record sales don't jump or do leaps\nAnd while you sleep I'm on the ground as I creep (you should creep)\nI got Pumas on my feet, Fresh gear everyday, every week\nYou know I keep it hot for my peeps\nNever cheap underground like the streets\n\nSlide, Slide, Dip, Dip, Shake\nMove it all around, Move it all around\nSlide, Slide, Dip, Dip, Shake\nMove it all around, Move it all around"}}, {"title": "Play That Beat", "album": "Under Construction", "year": "2002-11-12", "lyrics": "Imma beat y'all, play that beat (5x)\n(This is a
