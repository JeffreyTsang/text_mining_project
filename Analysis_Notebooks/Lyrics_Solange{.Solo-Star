together\nNo plans\nWhatever's clever\n\nI play selected tunes\nDictate the mood\nDon't be too cool\nTo kick off your shoes\nThe music can't be loud\n'Cause we can't hear what we're talkin' about\nI am in chill mode\nJust loungin' with my folks\nIf you name it we'll do it\nIf you want it we'll get it\nMake sure you don't miss it\nI know you'll regret it\nAnd you'll never forget it\nI'm takin' pictures\nBring somebody with ya\nYou know I'm not trippin'\n\nI'm not havin' a party\nI'm havin' a get together\nThat's when we get together\nAnd we do whatever\nI'm not havin' a party\nI'm havin' a get together\nThat's when we get together\nNo plans\nWhatever's clever\n\nNo special occasion\nJust good conversation\nI'm just havin' fun\n'Cause I'm always on the run\nI don't need no reason\n'Cause it's always in the season\nIt's pleasing to relax; we'll just enjoy ourselves\n\nI'm not havin' a party\nI'm havin' a get together\nThat's when we get together\nAnd we do whatever\nI'm not havin' a

baby\nReachless, romantic just keep dancing baby\nWhen you move like that\nI could just fall in love with you (In love with you)\nOoh keep climbing make your mark in here\nYour eyes keep shining

(ever)\n\nYou're undecided you wanna mingle more\nYour face just brightens when you think of me as yours\nAnd when you smile like that\nI could just fall in love with you (In love with you)\nSeems like the world suspects something baby\nThey should pinch themselves\nCause they ain't dreaming baby\nAnd when we kiss like that\nThe whole world would just fall in love too (In love too)\n\nClose

the plug I'm the socket\nAs time moved on, we become friends\nI knew it was love at first sight and it wasn't about the dividends\nYou was there when I needed you\nI remember writing letters on the road, I wanna be with you\nI know we young and we got time\nLittle souljahs need love, so girl I wanna make you mine\nWe can roll together, go to shows together\nMy best friend, girl, let's grow together\n\nLove has truly been good to me\nNot even one sad day\nA memory, I had since you've come my way\nI hope you know, I'm gladly go\nAnywhere you take me\nAnd ain't no limit to this love\nI'll follow you to the moon and the sky above\n\nWe could walk together, roll buses together\nYour mom called us Killer bees, we stuck together\nWe at parks playin' hide and go seek\nI find you or you find me\nThis was meant to be, they called us little one and shortie\nFind hugged up at every school party\nWe studied together, balled together\nSomebody said Cupid, it must have brought us together\nI love your cute eyes, and you love my tight braids\nPlayed video games almost everyday\nAnd when we're not together, we're on the phone\nTalkin' 'bout our first kiss and we don't want to be alone\n\nLove has truly been good to me\nNot even one sad day\nA memory, I had since you've come my way\nI hope you know, I'm gladly go\nAnywhere you take me\nAnd ain't no limit to this love\nI'll follow you to the moon and the sky above\n\nAnd I remember so, well, how your smile made me feel bright\nLike the sunshine, I'm so glad that you mine\nYou my Juliet, I never let the jealous ones between\nAnd that's a safe bet\nAnd we can get to studying after school is over\nHomework is a must so you can come over\nAnd afterwards we can hit the mall Sip Icee's\nAnd cotton candy after that come chill with the family\n\nGot to tell you how you threw me\nI'm so happy that you came in here and changed my world\nBye bye sadness, hello Romie\nYou're the only boy\nThat's why Solange is so in

know, I'd gladly go\nAnywhere you take me\nAnd ain't no limit to this love\nI'll follow you to the moon and the sky above\n\nThe first time, I met you, I didn't sweat you\nMy Juliet that I'd catch you\nGave you the key to my heart, you unlocked it\nA perfect match, you the plug I'm the socket\nAs time moved on, we become friends\nI knew it was love at first sight and it wasn't about the dividends\nYou was there when I needed you\nI remember writing letters on the road, I wanna be with you\nI know we young and we got time\nLittle souljahs need love, so girl I wanna make you mine\nWe can roll together, go to shows together\nMy best friend, girl, let's grow together\n\nLove has truly been good to me\nNot even one sad day\nA memory, I had since you've come my way\nI hope you know, I'm gladly go\nAnywhere you take me\nAnd ain't no limit to this love\nI'll follow you to the moon and the sky above\n\nWe could walk together, roll buses together\nYour mom called us Killer bees, we stuck together\nWe at parks playin' hide and go seek\nI find you or you find me\nThis was meant to be, they called us little one and shortie\nFind hugged up at every school party\nWe studied together, balled together\nSomebody said Cupid, it must have brought us together\nI love your cute eyes, and you love my tight braids\nPlayed video games almost everyday\nAnd when we're not together, we're on the phone\nTalkin' 'bout our first kiss and we don't want to be alone\n\nLove has truly been good to me\nNot even one sad day\nA memory, I had since you've come my way\nI hope you know, I'm gladly go\nAnywhere you take me\nAnd ain't no limit to this love\nI'll follow you to the moon and the sky above\n\nAnd I remember so, well, how your smile made me feel bright\nLike the sunshine, I'm so glad that you mine\nYou my Juliet, I never let the jealous ones between\nAnd that's a safe bet\nAnd we can get to studying after school is over\nHomework is a must so you can come over\nAnd afterwards we can hit the mall Sip Icee's\nAnd cotton candy after that come chill with the family\n\nGot to tell you how you threw me\nI'm so happy that you came in here and changed my world\nBye bye sadness, hello Romie\nYou're the only boy\nThat's why Solange is so in love\nI'll follow you to the moon in the sky above"}}, {"title": "Feel Good Song", "album": "Solo Star", "year": "2003-01-21", "lyrics": "My

it's enough\nCome and go with me\nThere's no problem here\nCome and go with me\nLet yourself be free\n\nCome on won't you ride with me\nI'll take you on a fantasy\nWe can get along in this wonderland\nCome on won't you ride with me\nI'll take you on a fantasy\nWe can get along in this wonderland", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86241ac5fe49fc4979db76d30830199b.600x600x1.jpg",

would go, you've never been\nAnd everywhere we go, everything we do\nSoon it all becomes a part of you\nWhen wishing on your star, remember who you are\nSo why don't you just....\n\nCome on won't you

stops turning when you're present and I know it's true\nBecause no one can make me feel like you do\nSo special to me, unique baby\n\nEnlightening, frightening\nAlways exciting\nThe timing has gotta

love will grow\nYeah, I mean I'm feeling you\n\nBeautiful underestimates my feelings when it comes to you\nThe world stops turning when you're present and I know it's true\nBecause no one can make me

you, where are you?\nCause I need to hear from you know (need to hear from you)\nIs this a mystery, constantly (don't think it is)\nIf you love me, Scooby-Dooby dooby doo\n\nWhere did my baby go?\nBoy take that mask off\nYou used to be all upon me\nNow you just trash talk\nSplit personlaity, pullin' 360's, don't even call me\nIt's such a mystery, my Scooby-Dooby dooby doo\n\n\n(Scoo - by - Doo)\nMurphy: Doo wop, doo wop\n(Scoo - by)\nMurphy: Oh, oh, yo, yo, yo\n\nBring back my baby so\nWe can be like old days\nI cannot take much more of\nYou and your silly ways\nI'm tryin' to reach you, but I'm not Miss Cleo\nYou got me so confused, Scooby-Dooby dooby doo\n\nYou know my 7 digits\nYou know my address Solo come and visit\nI'm just keepin' it realistic\nI'm young so I'm gon' kick it from Atlantic to the Pacific\nForget it, I admit it, I only leave it to missin'\nNow listen, meet me in Oklahoma\nWe take a private jet to West Bahamas\nMami wherever you want 'a just don't trip\nWe can dip just let me make it legit\nPermission slip for permission to slip\n\n\n(Scoo - by - Doo)\nMurphy: Doo wop, doo wah\n(Scoo - by)\nMurphy: Oh, oh, yo, yo, yo\n\nC'mon Solo, you know I ain't your average young dude\nYou know I can go wherever whenever I want to\nSo if I could stop at Lou, she's mystery and confusion\nFrequent flyer miles from St. Louis to Houston\nI would do it, see most girls be kind 'a mad\nLike Usher, \"I Got It Bad,\" so introduce me to Dad\nSo we can, read the psalms, make clothes with ya Mom's\nThumbs up like the Fonz, Murphy Lee and Solange, c'mon\n\n\nUh oh, oh\nUh

(With me and you)\nWhen everyone insisted that I love (Wasn't even true)\nWe tried so hard to make sure that we proved (We proved 'em wrong)\nBut now all that has changed And I am here (While you are gone)\nI miss the days, miles away, on the phone (Wishing you were there)\nAnd all the wonderful things that you said (Let me know you care)\nI miss the nights we spent, all the moments, (No one can

real\n(I know I'm young)\nIt's in the way he makes me feel\n(I know I'm young)\nI think my baby is the one\n(I know I'm young)\nIt's in the way he holds it down\n(I know I'm young)\nI know you think that this is real\n(And you're too young)\nI know exactly how you feel\n(And you're too young)\nToo young to know if he's the one\n(And you're too young)\nGirl you got time so slow it down\n\nI know you think I'm young and naive\nBut you gotta trust in me\nTo be strong and responsible\n'Cause I think I'm in love\nI know you think I'm young and naive\nBut you gotta trust in me\nTo be strong and responsible\n'Cause I think I'm in love\n\nIt's too complicated\nTo explain my relationship\nMy friends are hating\nCause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'\nLeave me alone and just let me be\nFind your own thing and get off of me\nIt's not complicated girl\nI've been where you are before\nI'm not underratin'\nI'm just tryin' to protect your feelings\nSolange, listen to me\nUnderstand what I'm sayin'\nYou'll realize one day how much I care\n\nI know you think I'm young and naive\nBut you gotta trust in me\nTo be strong and responsible\n'Cause I think I'm in love\nI know you think I'm young and naive\nBut you gotta trust in me\nTo be strong and responsible\n'Cause I think I'm in love\n\nSolange, you might love the boy\nEven sneak around the corner, kiss and hug the boy\nBut Beyonce been there before\nAnd she wouldn't want anybody to hurt you\nCause Matthew would drill the boy\nAnd I can't ignore that you young\nWe just don't want you to get sprung\nOn some young dumb-dumb with no crumbs\nGet all up in your heart and then run\nGettin' your heart broke is no fun\nNeither is somebody tellin' you he not the one\nYou gotta learn for yourself though\nAnd if you don't experience things\nThen you'll never know\nI don't want you wishin'\nYou coulda, shoulda, woulda did it, but you didn't\nListenin to other people's advice\nIt's your life\nMake your own decisions really\n\nIt's too complicated\nTo explain my relationship\nMy friends are hating\nCause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'\nLeave me alone and just let me be\nFind your own thing and get off of me\nIt's not complicated girl\nI've been where you are before\nI'm not underratin'\nI'm just tryin' to protect your feelings\nSolange, listen to me\nUnderstand what I'm sayin'\nYou'll realize one day how much I
