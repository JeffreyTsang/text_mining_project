I'm drunk as fuck, turn the fucking music up\nSo I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss\nYou're talking too much, who the fuck are you to us? Uterus\nI put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up\nI'm shooting up, you and her crew on turf, new desert\nI can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt\nI can smell the whore on a bitch when she walk around my crew to flirt\nIt's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first\nFuck a human nurse! I'm ill I used this earth to infuse the birth\nOf my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to\nSkip to my Lou, get hip to the pew\nYou can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view\nOf visuals, woo, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf\nThen meet your kids after school, and give them drugs cause it's cool, fucker\n\nShut 'em down!\nNigga, shut 'em down!\nShut 'em down!\n\nHodgy, fuck this beat, nigga, let's smoke weed\nThat shit I need, be the shit that's green\nA little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets\nAbout three or four more than needed be\nI got a eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape\nI hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes\nYou could smell us in places when we walk in our clothing is always covered in flakes\nEnough for two shake blunts; and what the fuck is this? Uh...\nI think this Mary is laced; my heart is beating at paces\nThat Pacquiao can't relate I'm fucking faded like gradients\nShit, I'm stuck like tape that's super glued\nTo the center of Kelly Price first waist\nIt's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary\nThe paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted\nFainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm\nLet's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit\n\nC'mon, my nigga. You don't even smoke, you weak as fuck, my nigga. You do not smoke, no tucks, my nigga. You're as weak as.. F your butt my nigga. Oh, mark ass nigga, Cuh, oh my God, bro.

now my balls, balls deep in this broad's jaw\nSwallow girl, it's just nut\nBitches scared to let me smash on they ass\nYeah, they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag\nLike me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin\nCamp Flog Gnaw, nigga, you can tell by the badge\n(Hodgy, pass me my inhaler)\nI'm sick of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome\nI'm animal, Noah's arking, all from this rapping nonsense\nFour stories in my home like \"What the fuck's an apartment?\" (nigga?)\nGet shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty\nTake bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity\nCussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience\nOh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch\n\nShut 'em down!\nNigga, shut 'em down!\nShut 'em down!\n\nI tumble-crush on huzzy sluts, give money up then nutty butt\nProfessor Nutty Buddy Klump gets petty when you touch his lunch\nLike, what the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck, turn the fucking music up\nSo I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss\nYou're talking too much, who the fuck are you to us? Uterus\nI put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up\nI'm shooting up, you and her crew on turf, new desert\nI can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt\nI can smell the whore on a bitch when she walk around my crew to flirt\nIt's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first\nFuck a human nurse! I'm ill I used this earth to infuse the birth\nOf my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to\nSkip to my Lou, get hip to the pew\nYou can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view\nOf visuals, woo, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf\nThen meet your kids after school, and give them drugs cause it's cool, fucker\n\nShut 'em down!\nNigga, shut 'em down!\nShut 'em down!\n\nHodgy, fuck this beat, nigga, let's smoke weed\nThat shit I need, be the shit that's green\nA little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets\nAbout three or four more than needed be\nI got a eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape\nI hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes\nYou could smell us in places when we walk in our clothing is always covered in flakes\nEnough for two shake blunts; and what the fuck is this? Uh...\nI think this Mary is laced; my heart is beating at paces\nThat Pacquiao can't relate I'm fucking faded like gradients\nShit, I'm stuck like tape that's super glued\nTo the center of Kelly Price first waist\nIt's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary\nThe paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted\nFainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm\nLet's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit\n\nC'mon, my nigga. You don't even smoke, you weak as fuck, my nigga. You do not smoke, no tucks, my nigga. You're as weak as.. F your butt my nigga. Oh, mark ass nigga, Cuh, oh my God, bro.

up\nAin't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up\nRest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it\nDarker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in\nOpen it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?\nDress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife\nThis is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites\nGrab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes\nGet some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night\nTo skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise\nNigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo\nGot a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows\nCracked a couple kids in the head with this cast\nHad a blast out Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes\nThat's how it goes, designing clothes\nCats on everything, cats on everything\nYou think all this money will make a happy me?\nBut I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat\nEverybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing\nCan't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous\nHop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office\nPissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called \"Pink Dolphin\"\nI roll here on a mean unicorn\nGreen hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform\nDowning that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up\nSomething like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause\n\nI am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy\n\nWhen you're alone thoughts start coming in\nPunching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging\nShit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle\nBut it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again\nI needed to get out of the house\nSo I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out\nIn a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles\nJust to see what all that fucking hype is about\nNow everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?\nCause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say\nIn court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day\nI was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay\n\nI am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy\n\nDo you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese\nWhile my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars\nAnd their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls\nSo I don't feel bad when they not eating\n(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)\nWolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman\nI'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles\nI'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca\nIf you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then\n\n\"Hey...\"\n\"Bitch.\"\n\"I'm right here.\"\n\"Yo, who's that..?\"\n\"That's Salem, that's my girlfriend. You stay the fuck away from her alright?\"\n\nI am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy"}}, {"title": "Awkward", "album": "Wolf", "year": "2013-04-01", "lyrics": "I was 16 when we first laid eyes\nScrawny little fucker, yeah, I was that guy\nAnd you was down for the weekend\nI was down for the greetings\nAnd you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing\nCouple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush\nGentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck\nBut it was my first official date so I was stuck, like\nIt was past curfew, and we was at the Grove\nAnd it was raining, and I had to be home\nAnd then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something\nAll I remember was your motherfucking face\n\nI play in your hair as you rub on my ears\nThen we awkwardly stare until our lips locked\nThen we awkwardly stared because our lips locked\nNow it's awkward in here because our lips locked\nFeels like i\u2019m floating in air\nCan't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked\nMan, this feels like a dream because our lips locked\nYou officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag\n\nYou gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I\u2019m holding your hand and\nMaking eye contact I feel like the damn man\nCause even though I am and get round of applauses\nI\u2019m insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance\nBut, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it\nCause holding your fingertips is golden\nI fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and\nGrip and keep holding on girl\n\nI play in your hair as you rub on my ears\nThen we awkwardly stare until our lips locked\nThen we awkwardly stared because our lips locked\nNow it's awkward in here because our lips locked\nFeels like i\u2019m floating in air\nCan't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked\nMan, this feels like a dream because our lips locked\nYou officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag\n\nYou got a nigga...Wait\nDon't think this is going to work\nThings got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt\nI haven\u2019t talked to you in a couple of days\nI got too comfortable\nAnd started to think that we was really a couple\nBut hey, (fuck you) at least there was time spent\nBut by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant\nBut when you realize, its awkward, your name still my password\nSo I\u2019m always fucking reminded\nYou got a nigga sprung\n\nYou're my girlfriend.. you're my girl (whether you like it or not!)\nYou're my girl.. you're my girlfriend, you're my girl girlfriend\nYou're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl (Shit, I know that you're not)\nYou're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend\nYou're my girl.. oooo\nYou're my, you're my Girl\nOoooo girlfriend... girlfriend..\nYou're my girlfriend you're my girl girlfriend you're my girl\nYou're my girlfriend", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dde81a162bfe7b81092c8630cdf16d70.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 10, "api_path": "/songs/80226", "apple_music_id": "600946355", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/80226/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["A song about a girl Tyler used to date in 2007."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["Story wise, this song is from Sam\u2019s point of view (again), telling Wolf about the first time he met Salem (which is how Cowboy ends)"]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["This song samples the drums from Erykah Badu\u2019s \u201cOn & On\u201d.

greetings\nAnd you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing\nCouple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush\nGentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck\nBut it was my first official date so I was stuck, like\nIt was past curfew, and we was at the Grove\nAnd it was raining, and I had to be home\nAnd then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something\nAll I remember was your motherfucking face\n\nI play in your hair as you rub on my ears\nThen we awkwardly stare until our lips locked\nThen we awkwardly stared because our lips locked\nNow it's awkward in here because our lips locked\nFeels like i\u2019m floating in air\nCan't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked\nMan, this feels like a dream because our lips locked\nYou officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag\n\nYou gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I\u2019m holding your hand and\nMaking eye contact I feel like the damn man\nCause even though I am and get round of applauses\nI\u2019m insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance\nBut, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it\nCause holding your fingertips is golden\nI fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and\nGrip and keep holding on girl\n\nI play in your hair as you rub on my ears\nThen we awkwardly stare until our lips locked\nThen we awkwardly stared because our lips locked\nNow it's awkward in here because our lips locked\nFeels like i\u2019m floating in air\nCan't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked\nMan, this feels like a dream because our lips locked\nYou officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag\n\nYou got a nigga...Wait\nDon't think this is going to work\nThings got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt\nI haven\u2019t talked to you in a couple of days\nI got too comfortable\nAnd started to think that we was really a couple\nBut hey, (fuck you) at least there was time spent\nBut by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant\nBut when you realize, its awkward, your name still my password\nSo I\u2019m always fucking reminded\nYou got a nigga sprung\n\nYou're my girlfriend.. you're my girl (whether you like it or not!)\nYou're my girl.. you're my girlfriend, you're my girl girlfriend\nYou're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl (Shit, I know that you're not)\nYou're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend\nYou're my girl.. oooo\nYou're my, you're my Girl\nOoooo girlfriend... girlfriend..\nYou're my girlfriend you're my girl girlfriend

I'm broke\nBitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money\nPopping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master\nThanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper\nI've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe\nYup, and a couple of them swallowed\nMeet me half way, bitch I'm going all in\nAnd I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco\n\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, (Golf Wang!)\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\n\nSo, a couple fags threw a little hissfit\nCame to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs\nAnd said I was a racist homophobic\nSo I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing\nFeelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing\nYou think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet (No homo, too soon)\nAnd while y'all are rolling doobies\nI be in my bedroom scoring movies\nStill excited like a fucking newbie\nSuck my dick, motherfucker, sue me\nMom got a new whip so she could scoop me\nA year ago, I ain't have no hoopty\nFour story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs\nJust to see where my fucking roof be\n\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, (Golf Wang!)\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\n\nWait a God damn second\nI'm tripping balls, David Beckham\nWould fall cause shit's going down\nJust like Rodney King swimming lessons\nNow me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms\nAnd purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction\n(wait a minute)\nIt sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker\nAnytime you play this shit loud\nBut that's just me trying to get milk now\nAnd the grunts of the god damn cow\nHit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter\nPan camera, repeat procedure\nAnd when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure\n\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, (Golf Wang!)\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, (Golf Wang!)\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\n\nCut it out!\nI said I didn\u2019t want no goddamn lettuce\nI don\u2019t want that shit\nI don\u2019t want your goddamn lettuce "}}, {"title": "Answer", "album": "Wolf", "year": "2013-04-01", "lyrics": "(Can we talk on the phone or something)\nBecause when I call (When I call you on the phone)\nI hope you pick up your phone\nI'd like to talk to you\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nYeah, I hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nYeah, I hope you answer\nBecause when I call\nI hope you pick up your phone\nI'd like to talk to you\nI hope you answer\n\nHey Dad, it's me, um...\nOh, I'm Tyler, I think I'd be your son\nSorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting\n\"Dad\" isn't your name, see \"Faggot\"'s a little more fitting\nMom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare\nYou Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair\nAlso stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs\nSo you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career\nBut fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see\nA world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you\nBut sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now\nThe fuck is an Okonma?

damn career\nBut fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see\nA world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you\nBut sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now\nThe fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley\nAnd I just ain't being passive, nigga\nYou a fucking faggot, nigga\nGot a show on Monday, guess who ain't getting no passes, nigga?\nBut if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga\nAnd call him...\nI hope he answer\n\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nYeah, I hope you answer\nBecause when I call (When I call, baby)\nI hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up)\nI'd like to talk to you\n(I hope you answer)\n\nSuck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts\nAce hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck\nAnd I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts\nFrank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic\nSyd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it\nSupposed to be gone 'til November but quickly came back in August\nI left two months through September to clearly remember all this\nI would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgia\nI'll call her number\nBut she won't answer\n\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nYeah, I hope you answer\n'Cause when I call (When I call, baby)\nI hope you pick up your phone\n(I'd like to talk to you)\nI hope you answer\n\nYou claim to hate my fucking guts\nBut say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding\nAnd, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts\nAnd hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts\nPhone ain't got no service -- this 3G is fucking worthless\nDay is getting dark like the area's turning urban\nYou'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a church is\nBut, I'ma get in contact regardless, and\nI hope you answer\n\nThat last verse was about this girl, haha"}}, {"title": "Slater", "album": "Wolf", "year": "2013-04-01", "lyrics": "Me and Slater just hit a curb\nBunny hop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D (Star Trak)\nMade a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs\nShit (what?) now I kick it in the 'burbs\n\nMe?

shit\nAnd I wonder if it fucked with they conscience\nIt fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it\nI couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit\nAnd that's where the money came from\n\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)\nThey call me Mr. Treat Your Nose\nIf you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)\nThey call me Mr. Treat Your Nose\nIf you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga\n\nShit's getting warmer, on that corner\nGotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners\nYour mother's a goner\nI warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar\nYou got a daughter, shit's getting harder\nThe only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom\nYou can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep\nAnd the seashore ain't saw ya\nYou got a mother, she don't support you\nBut you bought her a new house cause you love her\nGrowing up you barely had a roof\nNow you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof\nI guess you\u2019re accustomed what you\u2019re used to\nSo you bought two, nigga\nThey coming for you, nigga\nNiggas be hating I'm doing them bitches\nLike Susan and Karen be doing your pockets\nAnd running the man and he's losing his fucking mind\nAnd it\u2019s all an illusion\nWho was alludin' all of this potent?\nI am the reason your family is using and shooting up\nIt's my fault\nYou can, blame me, motherfucker\nFor killing your aunties and uncles\nThe hustle and hunger\nAll I wanted was a cheeseburger\nAnd a little chain, tucked\nDidn\u2019t realize this game fucked, up some lives\nOh, how's mine?\nMy conscience eats it up all the time but, other than that I\u2019m fine\nI got a little money in my pocket\n\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)\nThey call me Mr. Treat Your Nose\nIf you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)\nThey call me Mr. Treat Your Nose\nIf you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga\n\nNigga, we broke as fuck\nHomie got a chop shop, I stole that truck\nAnd I sold that dope, motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke\nBut like my work I give no fucks, I'm sorry (Yeah)\nShe could have been a doctor, nigga, I\u2019m sorry (Yeah, nigga)\nCould have been an actor and won that Oscar, said I'm sorry\nI sold that soap, and I killed black folk, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)\nBut I got a nice car, put my sister through school\nWhile my mama all cool, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)\nI'm in too deep and I can\u2019t see the shore, I'm sorry\n\nYou get addicted to the flip, we used to call it\nYou get addicted to the flip (I'm sorry)\nThe, the, the, the transaction, the hustling (I'm sorry)\nEven more than the money, it's just your job (I'm sorry)\nYou feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man\nAnd make this happen for that person (I'm sorry)\nAnd to do this and do that\nYou become the go to guy forever\nNext thing you know you\u2019re in too deep\nWay too deep, it'll scare the shit out of you\nYou wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death\nIt's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man\nYou know, dudes is buying choppers\nShoot down the people that look just like them\nDudes is buying guns to take down each other\nNobody wins, ya know what I mean?"}}, {"title": "Colossus", "album": "Wolf", "year": "2013-04-01", "lyrics": "Went to Six Flags, six fags came up\nAnd said \"Ayo! Can we get a pic?\" I said no\nAnd they said \"Oh! It's Wolf Gang, \"Yonkers\", Goblin is my shit though\"\nNow I'm like, \"fuck, I don't want to be an asshole\"\nSo I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon\nWith a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on\nSo fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath\n'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot\nNow I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo\nAll because they noticed the top with the box logo\nAnd them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard\nThey bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo\nI'm going fucking loco, \"Hey, Tyler, can I...?\"\nNo, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?\n\"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied\nUntil I heard \"Radicals,\" the last part got to me\nSee, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed\nNow I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be\nMy life is just like yours, no father\nMy momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom\nIn school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes\nSo everybody in them would say that I got problems\nSo when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em\nYou're an inspiration to niggas like me\nNot the niggas who like you just 'cause of lyrics and beats\nI'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be\nI heard the song \"Bastard\" right in the moment of heat\nNot in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat\nGun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord\nAnd it drew me in like predators carrying treats\nThen I said to myself, \"Fuck, is he speaking to me?\"\nSee, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat\nI mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?\nI carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard\nOn my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)\nThat's hard, that scar from playing air guitar\nWhen I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)\nTyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)\nI think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)\nWish I had a basement meant for me to hide you\nWe could play Xbox and listen to \"In Search Of...\" and eat donuts\nOver conversating 'bout what church does\nCome up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs\nI'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip\nAnd Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch\nYou should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)\nSee, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither\nAnd if I can't have you then she shouldn't either\nNo one should see you, but me in your t-shirt\nI worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)\nOdd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing\nI know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob\nBut I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)\nI ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times\n'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)\nI like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees\nI like pants that's cut, I like words like \"fuck\"\nI got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out\nNow paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)\nAnd I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day\nAnd now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a \"hey\" (sorry)\nAnd my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play \"VCR\"\nIn my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...\"\nAll right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic\nSo I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses\n(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit\nAnd I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick\nBut I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar\nAfter spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers\n\"Yonkers\" and \"Yonkers\" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about \"Yonkers\"\nI'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered\n\"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert\nI was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan\nThe one that say \"Sagan Lockhart\" and when you came out to \"Sandwitches\"\nThat's when my fucking boy-crush got started\"\n\nJust take this fucking picture man, shit...", "image":

Can we get a pic?\" I said no\nAnd they said \"Oh! It's Wolf Gang, \"Yonkers\", Goblin is my shit though\"\nNow I'm like, \"fuck, I don't want to be an asshole\"\nSo I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon\nWith a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on\nSo fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath\n'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot\nNow I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo\nAll because they noticed the top with the box logo\nAnd them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard\nThey bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo\nI'm going fucking loco, \"Hey, Tyler, can I...?\"\nNo, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?\n\"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied\nUntil I heard \"Radicals,\" the last part got to me\nSee, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed\nNow I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be\nMy life is just like yours, no father\nMy momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom\nIn school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes\nSo everybody in them would say that I got problems\nSo when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em\nYou're an inspiration to niggas like me\nNot the niggas who like you just 'cause of lyrics and beats\nI'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be\nI heard the song \"Bastard\" right in the moment of heat\nNot in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat\nGun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord\nAnd it drew me in like predators carrying treats\nThen I said to myself, \"Fuck, is he speaking to me?\"\nSee, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat\nI mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?\nI carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard\nOn my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)\nThat's hard, that scar from playing air guitar\nWhen I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)\nTyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)\nI think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)\nWish I had a basement meant for me to hide you\nWe could play Xbox and listen to \"In Search Of...\" and eat donuts\nOver conversating 'bout what church does\nCome up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs\nI'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip\nAnd Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch\nYou should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)\nSee, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither\nAnd if I can't have you then she shouldn't either\nNo one should see you, but me in your t-shirt\nI worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)\nOdd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing\nI know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob\nBut I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)\nI ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times\n'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)\nI like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees\nI like pants that's cut, I like words like \"fuck\"\nI got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out\nNow paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)\nAnd I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day\nAnd now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a \"hey\" (sorry)\nAnd my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play \"VCR\"\nIn my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...\"\nAll right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic\nSo I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses\n(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit\nAnd I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick\nBut I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar\nAfter spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers\n\"Yonkers\" and \"Yonkers\" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about \"Yonkers\"\nI'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered\n\"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert\nI was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan\nThe one that say \"Sagan Lockhart\" and when you came out to \"Sandwitches\"\nThat's when my fucking boy-crush got started\"\n\nJust take this fucking picture man, shit..."}}, {"title":

over, we could still dance girl\nBut I don't have no rhythm\nSo fuck it, take a chance with a nigga\nLike me, like me\nUhm, I said, the party isn't over\nWe could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm\nSo fuck it, take a chance with me\nThe party isn't over, we could still dance girl\nBut I don't have no rhythm\nSo fuck it, take a chance with a nigga\nLike me, like me\n\n\nYeah, um\nAll I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows\nMotherfuckers getting lynched and burned\nI earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good\nOn this brand new jacket\nThe donuts on the flag waving over the

got hectic whenever I fought back\nFor example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts\nThat's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times\nI think about you or something like that\nLost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else\nI don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong\n'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back\nThis isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo\nAnd find time to write facts, fuck\nI love you\nCan we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow\nYeah, that's good\n\nI fucking hate you, but I love you\nI'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled\nYou're good at being perfect\nWe're good at being troubled, yeah\nI fucking hate you\nBut I love you\nI'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled\nYou're good at being perfect\nWe're good at being troubled, yeah\n\nGirl, you fucking with my emotions\nThe fuck is all this noise about?\nI even considered picking up smoking\nYou turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?\nBut in my dog house\nMy bitch is the raddest\nCrazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest\nLook Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas\nYou're perfectly perfect for me\nWhat the fuck is this, practice?\nActually, if you even consider leaving\nI'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing\nAnd you'll see the meaning of stalking\nWhen I pop out the dark to find you\nAnd that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude\nThen proceed to fuck up your evening\nMake sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans\n'Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing\nI love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving\nAnd I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding\nLife without you has no goddamn meaning\nSorry\u2014I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason\nIt's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons\nI'll fall for you, but I love you\n\nI'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled\nYou're good at being perfect\nWe're good at being troubled\nYeah\n\nThe sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it\nThe sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it\nThe sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight\nThe sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it\nThe sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it\nThe sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight\n\nC'mon baby, even though I hate you, I still love you\nI love you\nAnd Salem, my love (I know)\nI'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)\n(Come here)\nI like when we hold hands\n(You're the best around)\nSee I get jealous (Fuck)\nAnd if I see that nigga (If I see him)\nI just might kill him (Look)\n(Look, I wanna strangle you, 'til you stop breathing)\nLove, love, love\n(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)\n(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)\n(Fuck, look)\nI'm in love (Love)\n\nI fucking hate you\nBut I love you\nI'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled\nYou're good at being perfect\nWe're good at being troubled, yeah\nI fucking hate you\nBut I love you\nI'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled\nYou're good at being perfect\nWe're good at being troubled, yeah\n\n\"Yo, why

he'll probably say the same\nFuck...\nHated by everyone, that's the way it seems\nI don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self esteem\nI sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone\nCause none of the cool kids would let me join a team\nDepression's on the stalk again\nMy best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough\nWhenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck\nCause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again\nI brought that on myself, see I should know my place\nBut not at lunchtime, see I know better than to show my face\nAround them, but the day I do it'll be everywhere\nWhen I share these feelings finally they gon' fucking care\n\nGrab a couple friends, start a couple riots\nCrash a couple-\nGather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers\nOdd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus\nIt's us, nigga\nI said it's us, nigga\n\nMurder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you\nWas when I... \"uh\" with all them burners, you\nThink that I'm some punk bullied bitch who ain't gon' trouble you\nWell, I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you dont mind\nUmm \"Who are you again?\" I'm Samuel and that's Tyler\nWe came to get wild and style in these trench coats!\nDon't start asking what's packing in these trench coats!\nJust know if you start acting, I'm grabbing for these trench coats!\nMy step-father called me a fag\nI'll show him a fag, and I'll light a fire up in his ass\nAnd recently them assholes been fucking with me in class\nSo I'ma keep them muhfuckers there and make sure they pass huh\nMy prom date, she dismissed my offer\nSo I'mma  her and toss her in the principal's office\n(Tyler, I'll go with you)\nOh, now you wanna conversate with me try to be my friend? (Where are my parents at?-) Don't worry, you'll probably never see them again\n\nGrab a couple friends, start a couple riots\nCrash a couple-\nGather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers\nOdd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus\nIt's us, nigga\nI said it's us, nigga\n\nBum bum bum bum bum\nBum bum bum bum bum\nBum. bum. bum. burumrumrumrum bum bum bum\nBum bum bumbumbumbum, hehe\nWe are the Sams, and we're dead -- it's just four of us\nWe come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious\nWe took their heads but we just took back what they took from us\nI guess we lost ours\n\nMusic had nothing to do with my final decision\nI just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention\nBut nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had\nSince I was a kid but I'm growing up so they're missing\nI didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry\nI wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army\nI'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me\nMomma I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?\nI don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home\nAnd I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone\nAnd I... I hear helicopters make a dip\nI'm fucking reloaded -- I told you all that I ain't taking shit\nYou better back up before this Mac start to lift up\nI'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up\nThe difference between us and our class is tan khakis\nI got 99 problems and all of them's being happy"}}, {"title": "Parking Lot", "album": "Wolf", "year": "2013-04-01", "lyrics": "I don't fucking like this shit, fuck\nAh!\n\nTall ugly nigga with lips bigger than Tigger\nOnly blue print on these Vans like I don't listen to Jigger (Uhh)\nCotton-picking nigger, Golf Wang season sicker than the block\nColette and skateshops, where wolves deal 'em (Uhh)\nWorkshop is awesome, ask Dill and let's pretend\nLike I'm not making dollar Bill Withers on these fucking stickers (Uhm)\nPulling down my zipper and she quick to say she doesn't suck\nBitch, cut the crap like dyke booty when they scissor (Uhh)\nPink haired Mrs., I'm her mister, sipping Slurpees, bag of chips\nNow show your tits for mister Fuji, take a picture (Uhh)\nOF is popping like a blister, need some Listerine\nSpitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister (Uhh)\nSick of being black, sipping paint thinner out a tin flask\nPlotting on the babysitter before dinner\nAnd hopefully I get her, if I don't, fuck it then\nSee I never simp son, polar opposite of Smithers, I'm done bitch\n\nUntil the ozone leaves and the Earth is hot\nLoiter Squad lurking in the parking lot\nThe moon now working and the stars align\nI stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind\n(Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot) Yeah\n(Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot) Ah man\n(Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot) Ah man\n(Yeah) Yeah\n\n(Somebody told me...)

Months later you're world famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!\"\n\nWatch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga\nNothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch you, nigga\nNever made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga\nPassing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga\nWe ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch\nI'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch\nBuncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick\nThem young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense\nWe the last of a dying breed\nAnd we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs\nYou stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please\nMy pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees\nBitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing\nNigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person\nWatch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping\nMake actions, fuck rehearsing\n\nNigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\nSummer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\n\nIn a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather\nSitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather\nCan name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether\nOr not they got one, tried to change their life for the better\nI was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched\nI was defiant, always said, \"Fuck shit\"\nHated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one\nAlso hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some\nSee I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's\nAnd I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell\nFucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele\nAnd bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille\nI bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well\nI tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself\nThese fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves\nSee, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but\nReally, boy? Poseurs looking silly, boy\nI'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi\nNot a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese\nNa'kel Smith, Transworld page 64\nPoppin' like oil ollie in fire flames\nI'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game\nThe fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name\nAbout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes\nBut he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists\nGod damn menace, 666 and he's not finished\nAnd my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?\nSee y'all niggas tripping, man\nLook at that article that says my subject matter is wrong\nSaying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs\nLook at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me\nThough I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat\nLook at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind\nBut talk is money, I said, \"Hi,\" I guess I bought him some time\nLook at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?\nThey thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?\nBut then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan\nAnd it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements\nAnd MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing\nBruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings\n\"Analog\" fans are getting sick of the rape\nAll the \"Tron Cat\" fans are getting sick of the lakes\nBut what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints\nBut I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank\nOh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?\nMy fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct\nFuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink\nRecord the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch\n\nNigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\n\nSummer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\n\nThis shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering\nSo much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me\nBut Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)\nAll I\u2019m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me\nThat the 40's half off, like you know that cliff\nDon't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)\nOr get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids\nSo maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)\nMalt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and\nAll of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)\nDirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs\nBrother the Pigeons is us\nBid you goodnight and good luck\n(Oh, shut the fuck up!)\n(Gunshot)\n\nSamuel's here!
