All right, I don\u2019t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. That's what I believe in not believing in.\"\n\"So what keeps you alive?\"\n\"Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don\u2019t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that keeps me going. I\u2019m a pretty dark person, I\u2019ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing.\"\nThank you\n\nSitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go\nRight now, freestyle or write down, whatever\nIt still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts\nAnd Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect\nI ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses\nYou should either hear me now or go deaf\nOr end up dead, die trying and know death\nMight end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath\nFuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga\nI mean that from the bottom of my heart\nYou see my art is all I have\nAnd victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt\nStill knock them out the park like a fucking tow car\nLet bygones be bygones, but where I'm from\nWe buy guns and more guns to give to the young\nI'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga\nInside the system all you envision is trap niggas\nMy uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight\nHe told me \"Rap about life, not rap niggas\"\nThat's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'\nMy stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching\nI start evaluating, then my final intuition\nIs that you wishing a come up, would just come up\nWe used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse\nNiggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre\nAnd this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph\nWrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance\nPut burners in the hands of the black man\nOne hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant\nYou probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am\nYou probably even listened to \"Faith,\" and think I know Zion\nBut really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth\nBecause it seem like it's always clashing with science\nI got a big fear of flying\nMy future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice\nI ain't lying\nI swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick\nThe school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance\nYou walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness\nYou just mind your business\nYou just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis\nIt's kind of scary, ain't it?\nYou can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous\nJust let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless\n'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it\nSo much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation\nSo if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him\nFacing 25 to life with a murder charge\nYour enemies was the prey and now you pray to God\nI pray these bars get farther than Compton\nAnd if our record never break, I still won\u2019t break my promise\nI promise to keep it honest\nSecret society, all we ask is trust\nAnd all we lack is communication like service sucks\nThe people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come\nAnd I'm like, \"The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?\"\nGotta keep it pushing\nCan't let the government tell me how my future looking\nI'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'\nIf the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'\nNever will I surrender\nI been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta\nIn the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter\nHow splendid, I guess my project had did it\nGot all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different\nThey said seven tracks, I said 15\nCalled it an EP, they said I\u2019m trippin'\nBut little did they know, I\u2019m tryna' change the rules\nThat we\u2019ve been confined to, so the corporate won\u2019t make decisions\nUppity bitches handling business\nKilling our dreams, stealing our vision\nOut in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home\nIn LA everybody think they fucking on\nHop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit\nWho we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone\nI swear to God most of y'all cats just don\u2019t know Kendrick\nYou barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended\nAin\u2019t doing this for my health, I\u2019m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes\nOccupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions\nJust to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living\nLook, the mastermind took the master's mind\nJust the perfect time, just to master mine\nJust to match the grind with precision\nLook, the mastermind took - (cough)\n\nWe would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP.

should be growing now\n(Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga)\nWhere are we going, we should be slowing down\nWhere are you going, we should be growing now\n\nThat\u2019s what she said to me, that place I used to call home\nIs just a bed to me\nWe don\u2019t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep\nMeanwhile I\u2019m in these streets with everybody, I\u2019m trying to get it\nAnd she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me\nAs they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness\nLook each other in the face and barely blink\nI tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink\nSo if my letters don\u2019t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync\n\nWhere are we going, why are we slowing down\nWhere are you going, we should be growing now\n\nThat\u2019s what it said to me, but the place I call ambition\nNow dead to me, gone and forgotten, I\u2019m off track\nLike Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping\nFucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions\nClub night, guys and dolls\nBalling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball\nI\u2019m calling out for help, my engineer called\nTold me come to the studio but I wanna tell him, nah\n\nWhere are we going, why are we slowing down\nWhere are you going, we should be growing now\n\nThat\u2019s what he said to me\nBut that place we call Heaven's unfair to me, only 144 can go\nSeven billion people on planet Earth today\nIs there something that I don\u2019t know\nI know to follow Him rather following people\nOr follow vanity cause that means I\u2019m following evil\nGuess I\u2019m following evil, I should follow cathedral\nBlessings I need but live like I don\u2019t need you\n\nWhere are we going, why are we slowing down\nWhere are you going, we should be growing now\n\nSo in conclusion\nWe all seem to stumble, planning our own demise\nForgetting the big picture and making it wallet size\nSo to what is important in my life, I apologize\nI promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified\nWe all get distracted, the question is\nWould you bounce back or bounce backwards?\nWould you not know how to act or take action?\nIt\u2019s just a part of life and if your vision\u2019s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight\n\nTryna visualize how to get it right but my vision\u2019s so blurry\nTryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we\u2019re always in a hurry now\nAnd if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would\nThen we could grow a little closer, I think we\u2019re getting closer\nI think we\u2019re getting closer"}}, {"title": "Night of the Living Junkies", "album":

I hear 'em hate\nI laugh at it rather than jab at it\nThen continue eternal life as a crack addict\n'Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug\nCold turkey? No sir\nYou gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above\nYou definitely know, probably I gotta give it up\n\nLips, hips, hair drips down her back\n(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)\nThe only girl that can make time\nThen make me, stop...\n\nShe looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie\nWhere's she from?

Why you couldn't?\nWhy you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious\nThe moment that we first started?\nWhy you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?\nWhy you let me use yours cus I don't got mine?\nWhy you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up\nOr when niggas holla, \"What's up?\" you give a dry response?\nWhy you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?\nWhy you always buy me something when you going shopping?\nWhy you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me\nWant my company rather than going club hopping?\nWhy you treating my momma like she your momma too?\nWhy you making promises that you'll forever do?\nWhatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family\nThese are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you\" (Sometimes)\n\nWe hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\nWe hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\nWe hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\nWe hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\n\nSometimes I, sometimes I feel we share\nNothing in common, it ain't fair\nBut where do we seem to fall\nWhere do we seem to fall\nTender love and care, once upon a time\nOnce upon a time, we was there\n\nAnd so she said \"Why you gotta be so mean to me?\nWhy you don't know what you mean to me?\nWhy you always playing games?

fuck rapping, I need money now\nLike should I start trapping?\nIf what I write down don't collect this very moment\nThen I'm on it, no question\nIn the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's see\nDo I cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some E?\nOxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?\nThis is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat\nI be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet\nThis is me, frustrated, battling my own evils\nFinna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo\nOr should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip\nAnd hope one day it flourish to a kilo\nTrack record of a hustler\nRather records on the needle, making music\nClocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing\nMy nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?\n\"I thought you had a show?\" Well, my nigga, I guess I didn't\nI'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting\nEspecially when your homies pushing V8 engines\nTwenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up\nThree-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough\nThis industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution\nCurb-serving, or I might be in your store boosting\nTwo-elevens with Mac-11s like fuck Hip Hop\nDon't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be Pac\nJust give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got\nOr everything getting shot, for nothing\nLeave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling\nWatch, the plans of a young man sponsor\nMoving grams like relocating your mom's momma\nThen expand to the Hoover dam, water, sherm\nContraband, they yearn for the butt-naked\nFuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds\nI disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down\nAnd pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me\nYou'll know I always had a passion for riddling, writing\nBut lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten\nMy future financially, so please don't be mad at me\nI gotta do what I gotta do, no shit\nSo I tell my nigga, \"Front me, let me put it on the strip\"\nThen give it back when I think about the consequence\nShit...\n\nThere are times, when you need someone\nI will be by your side\nOh darling, cause there is a light that shines\nSpecial for you, and me yeah\nI-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances\nBefore they pass, they pass, they pass\nPass me by, oh darling\nYou've got to look at the other side\n\nR.O.T.C\u2014Right On Time Conscience"}}, {"title": "Barbed Wire", "album": "Overly Dedicated", "year": "2010-09-14", "lyrics": "One time\nReporting live\nCompton, California\n\nHave you ever felt like, like you never get life?\nLike you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?\nBack down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep\nChasing for the wind but you never win the track meet\nOh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter\nAnd life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her\nI struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing\nI was so sincere like Nas first name, in Belly\nThey tell me, it's very difficult to see 25\nAnd if I survive it's probably with a celly\nMy opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats\nIn the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's\nThey want me unemployed, until I hit the streets\nFulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed\nFucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues\nBB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm\n\nIn the club like fuck it, though\nThey say it's only one life, life, life\nAnd if you say I can't live comfortable\nI'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie\nSo while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass\nCelebrate the very day that I get past\nThrough the barbed wire\nWe are, we are (fine)\nWe are, we are (true)\nThrough the, through barbed (wires)\nWe will, will break (through)\nSo while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass\nCelebrate the very day that I get past\nThrough the barbed wire\n\nHave you ever felt like, like you never get life?\nLike you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?\nTryna get away from the world's stereotype\nBarbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately\nIn need of some inspiration, see what the people saying\nShe gon have a baby then flee from her education\nAt the age of 16, credit card scam schemes\nSee a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality\nShe'll never get by, no how, no way\nWelfare recipient, property of the state\nHousing, Section 8, corner store prostitute\nThe owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute\nHoodrat trashy, six baby daddies\nAnd this baby daddy is new to the family\nChilling in pajamis, waiting on the first\nFast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she\n\nIn the club like fuck it, though\nThey say it's only one life, life, life\nAnd if you say she can't live comfortable\nShe gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie\nSo while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass\nCelebrate the very day that she get past\nThrough the barbed wire\nWe are, we are (fine)\nWe are, we are (true)\nThrough the, through barbed (wires)\nWe will, will break (through)\nSo while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass\nCelebrate the very day that she get past\nThrough the barbed wire\n\nHave you ever felt like, you finally got life\nYou finally got right? No longer a black sheep\nLiving off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian\nIn the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married\nWhat a feeling of overcoming the odds\nIt's like we just hit the lottery, my God\nThere must be a God, cause golly\nYou done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali\nNow ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs\nAnd you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks\nAnd she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar\nMaking good decisions, got a independent business-mind\nAnd both of y\u2019all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way\nJust tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day\nBut they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth\nYou must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out\n\nIn the club like fuck it, though\nThey say it's only one life, life, life\nAnd if you say they can't live comfortable\nThey gone tell you that's a lie, lie, lie\nSo even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad\nKnow it's a barbed wire that's always in your path\nThrough the barbed wire (just laugh)\nThen everybody say...\n'Cause I won't get caught again\nAnd I'm here to stop the trends\nYou can catch me if you try\nDisappear into the night\nAnd I'm gone\n\nSo you made it past all the barbed wires?\nThere's one more left *Gunshot*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e1efc6d0a7044dbf2f0776a12ed85b8.620x620x1.jpg", "artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "raw": {"annotation_count": 20, "api_path": "/songs/49458", "apple_music_id": "1171563756", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/49458/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Off of his \u201c(O)verly (D)edicated\u201d mixtape.", {"tag": "br"}, "Kendrick does his artful rendering of living in the now.

sort of like a black sheep?\nBack down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep\nChasing for the wind but you never win the track meet\nOh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter\nAnd life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her\nI struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing\nI was so sincere like Nas first name, in Belly\nThey tell me, it's very difficult to see 25\nAnd if I survive it's probably with a celly\nMy opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats\nIn the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's\nThey want me unemployed, until I hit the streets\nFulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed\nFucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues\nBB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm\n\nIn the club like fuck it, though\nThey say it's only one life, life, life\nAnd if you say I can't live comfortable\nI'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie\nSo while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass\nCelebrate the very day that I get past\nThrough the barbed wire\nWe are, we are (fine)\nWe are, we are (true)\nThrough the, through barbed (wires)\nWe will, will break (through)\nSo while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass\nCelebrate the very day that I get past\nThrough the barbed wire\n\nHave you ever felt like, like you never get life?\nLike you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?\nTryna get away from the world's stereotype\nBarbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately\nIn need of some inspiration, see what the people saying\nShe gon have a baby then flee from her education\nAt the age of 16, credit card scam schemes\nSee a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality\nShe'll never get by, no how, no way\nWelfare recipient, property of the state\nHousing, Section 8, corner store prostitute\nThe owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute\nHoodrat trashy, six baby daddies\nAnd this baby daddy is new to the family\nChilling in pajamis, waiting on the first\nFast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she\n\nIn the club like fuck it, though\nThey say it's only one life, life, life\nAnd if you say she can't live comfortable\nShe gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie\nSo while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass\nCelebrate the very day that she get past\nThrough the barbed wire\nWe are, we are (fine)\nWe are, we are (true)\nThrough the, through barbed (wires)\nWe will, will break (through)\nSo while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass\nCelebrate the very day that she get past\nThrough the barbed wire\n\nHave you ever felt like, you finally got life\nYou finally got right? No longer a black sheep\nLiving off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian\nIn the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married\nWhat a feeling of overcoming the odds\nIt's like we just hit the lottery, my God\nThere must be a God, cause golly\nYou done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali\nNow ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs\nAnd you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks\nAnd she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar\nMaking good decisions, got a independent business-mind\nAnd both of y\u2019all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way\nJust tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day\nBut they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth\nYou must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out\n\nIn the club like fuck it, though\nThey say it's only one life, life, life\nAnd if you say they can't live comfortable\nThey gone tell you that's a lie, lie, lie\nSo even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad\nKnow it's a barbed wire that's always in your path\nThrough the barbed wire (just laugh)\nThen everybody say...\n'Cause I won't get caught again\nAnd I'm here to stop the trends\nYou can catch me if you try\nDisappear into the night\nAnd I'm gone\n\nSo you made it past all the barbed wires?\nThere's one more left *Gunshot*"}}, {"title": "Average Joe", "album": "Overly Dedicated", "year": "2010-09-14", "lyrics": "The hardest thing for me to do\nIs to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars\nThat's the hardest thing\n\nWho is K.

sixteen bars\nThat's the hardest thing\n\nWho is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton\nOn the curb writing raps next to a gunshot\nOn the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell\nThe fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled\nEveryone I knew was either Crip or Piru\nCousins in elementary, relatives in high school\nWith that being said, each one of their rivals\nWas aiming something at my head, I needed survival\nGot jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back\nAnd I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes\nIn the midst of staying neutral and discrete\nMy momma said you're judged by the company you keep\nBut what you can consider, that if it goes down\nThey'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga\nSo if you ask what I'm doing\nI'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and\n\nThis is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)\nThis is why they fuck with me (do what I do, ya know?)\nI'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)\nBut one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know\n\nI was walking from Centennial\nWhen an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like \"hol' up\"\n\"Where you from?\" I don't bang\n\"Where you stay?\" Westside, that's a Piru gang to be exact\nWell aware they had blue across they hat\nDropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac\nShots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet\nCrossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet\nChirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew\nWhat happened, and meet 'em outside the garage\nNever seen that many guns in my life\nI was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge\nGrabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in\nSomebody said, \"fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer\nYou my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you\"\nThought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but\n\nThis is why they fuck with me (I told you, nigga)\nThis is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)\nI'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)\nBut one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know\n\nI don't do black music, I don't do white music\nI do everyday life music\nGive 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it\nYou say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold\nAnd this is for my county building children\nIn Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering\nI use perseverance in this mad city\nWhere the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats\nBernie Mac died, it's no joke\nDon't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves\nSeven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life\nI could fall out the sky like twice\nAnd land in the land of the AKs\nAnd the minivans where the fan never on\nCause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket\nIn other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know?\n\nThis is why they fuck with me (haha)\nThis is why they fuck with me (real talk)\nI'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)\nBut one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know\n\nSo there you have it\nBut I'mma leave you with this\nAn O.G. once told me\nA real gangster is either dead or in jail\nOr behind the scenes getting real money\nI'm gone"}}, {"title": "H.O.C.", "album": "Overly Dedicated", "year": "2010-09-14", "lyrics": "H.O.C., H.O.C\nAll the real smokers get me H.O.C\nAll the real smokers get me H.O.C\nH.O.C., H.O.C\nAll the real smokers get me H.O.C\nAll the real smokers get me H.O.C\n\nEverybody know I spit that other shit\nShit that make you duck for cover shit\nShit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit\nEspecially when Drop drop the beat\nI drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs\nJump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream\nThey jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem\nThat's a jab, you should bob and weave\nLike Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve\nI go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd\nCause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb\nYou telling me the kush make you think on level four?\nI'm on five, you saying that I can level more?\nIn high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress\nDidn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects\nI stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time\nCreation of man, and Columbine\n\nBet you think that this some high shit that I wrote\nProbably think I'm off the kush or the hydro\n(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI really appreciate that you share your Indo\nBut a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\n\nLook, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers\nJust cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa\nKnowing damn well they can't hit the sour\nThey're new booties, they probably need baby powder\nMy skill shower over your city for 40 days\n40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves\nBefore you get it twisted, like 40 gays\nMy flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised\nThose the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout\nYou know the type of rhymes you don't talk about\nCopy my session on a disc when the session ends\nSo my momma can have it and play it for her friends\nBrag on me, like \"My son's 'bout to win\nSomehow, someday, and I don't care when\"\nI might hit the gin once a month\nI'll let you inhale, like an atheist\n\nBet you think that this some high shit that I wrote\nProbably think I'm off the kush or the hydro\n(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI really appreciate that you share your Indo\nBut a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\n\nI'll take you back to the 9th grade\nWhen Dough Boy had me high for 4 days\nThat's my nigga, he a street nigga\nProbably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga\nBut anyway I think it was some purple\nTold me \"Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you\"\nI didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade\nSwear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes\nThat was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored\nThe same time I start writing like a fucking monster\nI'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders\nJust underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T\nLaying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks\nNow what you 'bout? Nothing huh\nAm I a square cause I don't puff a square?\nAre my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah\n\nBet you think that this some high shit that I wrote\nProbably think I'm off the kush or the hydro\n(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI

smokers get me H.O.C\nH.O.C., H.O.C\nAll the real smokers get me H.O.C\nAll the real smokers get me H.O.C\n\nEverybody know I spit that other shit\nShit that make you duck for cover shit\nShit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit\nEspecially when Drop drop the beat\nI drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs\nJump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream\nThey jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem\nThat's a jab, you should bob and weave\nLike Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve\nI go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd\nCause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb\nYou telling me the kush make you think on level four?\nI'm on five, you saying that I can level more?\nIn high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress\nDidn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects\nI stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time\nCreation of man, and Columbine\n\nBet you think that this some high shit that I wrote\nProbably think I'm off the kush or the hydro\n(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI really appreciate that you share your Indo\nBut a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\n\nLook, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers\nJust cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa\nKnowing damn well they can't hit the sour\nThey're new booties, they probably need baby powder\nMy skill shower over your city for 40 days\n40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves\nBefore you get it twisted, like 40 gays\nMy flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised\nThose the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout\nYou know the type of rhymes you don't talk about\nCopy my session on a disc when the session ends\nSo my momma can have it and play it for her friends\nBrag on me, like \"My son's 'bout to win\nSomehow, someday, and I don't care when\"\nI might hit the gin once a month\nI'll let you inhale, like an atheist\n\nBet you think that this some high shit that I wrote\nProbably think I'm off the kush or the hydro\n(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI really appreciate that you share your Indo\nBut a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\n\nI'll take you back to the 9th grade\nWhen Dough Boy had me high for 4 days\nThat's my nigga, he a street nigga\nProbably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga\nBut anyway I think it was some purple\nTold me \"Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you\"\nI didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade\nSwear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes\nThat was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored\nThe same time I start writing like a fucking monster\nI'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders\nJust underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T\nLaying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks\nNow what you 'bout? Nothing huh\nAm I a square cause I don't puff a square?\nAre my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah\n\nBet you think that this some high shit that I wrote\nProbably think I'm off the kush or the hydro\n(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI really appreciate that you share your Indo\nBut a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\nI don't even smoke, I don't even smoke\n\nH.O.C., H.O.C\nAll the real smokers give me H.O.C\n(Bitch I'm blowed!)"}}, {"title": "Cut You Off (To Grow Closer)", "album": "Overly Dedicated", "year": "2010-09-14", "lyrics": "Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!\nYou boo-boo, you T'd\nYou turned down, you thirsty\nYou boo-boo!\n\nUh, I'm tryna learn something new\nI'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar\nI read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God\nThey say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good\nInto existence, that instant my dreams will unlock\nMoney flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock\nAnd by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed\nLike a small garage in your backyard\nI'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine\nBut I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness\nAlways hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with\nWho she wanna fight, who wearing a weave\nWho Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys\nTo the car she drove last year or who fucking on who\nAnd who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves\nBut before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off\n\n'Cause every time you come around\nYou be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God\nShut the fuck up... hoe\nEvery time you come around\nYou be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say...\n\nUh, I'm tryna learn something new\nI'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me\nOr at least inquire similar desires\nTo do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P\nI'm talking ideas, motivation\nIt's more than making, enemies, my nigga\nOh, that's not ya memo?

new\nI'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar\nI read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God\nThey say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good\nInto existence, that instant my dreams will unlock\nMoney flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock\nAnd by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed\nLike a small garage in your backyard\nI'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine\nBut I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness\nAlways hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with\nWho she wanna fight, who wearing a weave\nWho Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys\nTo the car she drove last year or who fucking on who\nAnd who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves\nBut before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off\n\n'Cause every time you come around\nYou be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God\nShut the fuck up... hoe\nEvery time you come around\nYou be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say...\n\nUh, I'm tryna learn something new\nI'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me\nOr at least inquire similar desires\nTo do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P\nI'm talking ideas, motivation\nIt's more than making, enemies, my nigga\nOh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing\nOn how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga\nI function with you and you flaunt your pistol\nEvery second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo\nWhere so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing\nWho baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend\nThat shit is mad depressing, bringing me down\nSpeak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid\nRather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style\nOr his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off\n\n'Cause every time you come around\nYou be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God\nShut the fuck up... scary ass\nEvery time you come around\nYou be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say\n\nUh, I'm tryna learn something new\nI'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star\nI'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa\nStudying art... now paint that picture\nLife behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?\nI murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?\nSee what I was taught, family is all I need\nBut indeed them too can run me right up a tree\nConstantly talking shit 'bout the next relative\nWanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in\nEver since grandma died, everyone parted ways\nArgue on holidays, left my uncle in prison\nFor 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms\nYeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come\nCome to my house just to yap about your own people\nDang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins\nI would prolly cut y'all off too, yep\n\n'Cause everytime y'all come around\nY'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up\nKeep it running, Ali\nEvery time you come around\nYou be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say\n\nSo tell 'em, \"Shut the fuck up!\"\nTell 'em, \"Shut the fuck up!\"\nYeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd\nYou turnt down, you thirsty\nTell 'em \"Shut the fuck up!\"\nTell 'em \"Shut the fuck up!\"\nYeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you T'd\nYou turnt down, you thirsty\nYou thirsty, you boo-boo\nYou T, you turnt down\nYou boo-boo, you T'd\nYou boo-boo, you turnt down\nYou thirsty, you T'd\nYou boo-boo, you turnt down\nYou boo-boo, you T'd\nYou turnt down, you weak\nYou weak, yo\u2019 bitch weak\nYo- (laughs)\nYou boo-boo, you T (laughs)\nKeep all that\n\nWhat is HiiiPoWeR?\nHiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live\nSee it\u2019s known today that the human race is nothing\nNo morals, no standards\nWhat we\u2019re about to do is raise the level of expectations\nNo, you don\u2019t have to have a lot of money\nYou don\u2019t have to be rich\nBut you will be rich in mind and spirit\nSome say it\u2019s as big as a crew, some say it\u2019s as big as a gang\nHiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it\u2019s as big as a religion"}}, {"title": "Heaven and Hell", "album": "Overly Dedicated", "year":

Africans, hostages in Afghanistan\nNot to mention another prison, child molesting\nCow intestines, Botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested\nSecret society weapon, opium plant manifested\nThen turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message\nTo hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map\nJust a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap\nAdolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying\nThe governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'\nThese cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph\nDistincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion\nSee that's forbidden, we fryin'\nMy nigga, what it look like?\nThat's exactly what Hell look like\n\nTell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy\nTell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!\nTell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy\nTell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell

(Where you been?)\nIt's been months and I haven't heard from you, I need you\nIt's been months and I haven't heard from you, come back to me\nCome back, I need you in my life (Come back)\nI miss you, I miss you, come back to me, I miss you\n\nWhat's up baby? (What's up baby?)\nIt's been a while (Been a while)\nYou been good? (Been good?)\nI've been around (Uh)\nDifferent girls (Where?)\nDifferent towns (Yeah)\nTo keep it real (Keep it real)\nYou missing out (Uh)\nI\u2019m on board, next city (Onboard, next city)\nRandom call, text with me (Random call, uh)\nLike, I miss you so much, have sex with me\nNot right now, look you know I got the ex with me\nShe like fuck that (Fuck that)\nI don't care Dom (Care Dom)\nSo selfish and that really isn't fair Dom (Fair Dom)\nMeet me here, where Dom? (Meet me here, where Dom?)\nGet undressed, yeah Dom (Uh)\nYeah Dom, what you need?\nSome bomb head? A bag of weed? (Bomb head, yeah)\nGood food? Japanese?

Mr. Chows (Uh-huh)\nTruant like a student, you the principal (Alright)\nSchooled me on timing, we was both shining (Alright, alright)\nLike the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond (True)\nI was Your Highness, you was my queen (Uh-huh, uh-huh)\nYou got over him when I got in between\nWatching Martin on TBS as it was tedious\nFor us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished\nBut it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together\nEvery time I put the head in you would panic\nAnd come right down like an avalanche\nMake your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants\nBaby how that sound? Kosher, no sir\nWake it back up, Folger's holsters\nBy my waistline, shot for your heart and\nYou called it a hate crime, say you want me back\nAnd your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit\n4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?\n\nThat girl is smoking\nAnd can you believe that I'm her focus?\nIt ain't hard to see she got me open\nAnd together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on\n\nI upped and walked out, now she crying 'cause\nShe need me, I got that Jon Brion love\nHad to find love, we called it punch-drunk\nWe was a two-piece, she was a one-punch\nYou know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out\nMy heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out\nThere we go again, what the fuck you talking 'bout?\nWe used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house\nSmoking beedies, laying on the futon\nMemories I got saved up like a coupon\nAnd we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed\nI was broke then, couldn't cop the best weed\nThen she would just leave in a black hatchback\nHomies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that\nI would say \u201cYep\u201d, smiling so freely\nThat was back then, but I bet she still need me\nShe need me, she need me\nShe need me, she need me\nI would say \u201cYes\u201d, smiling so freely\nThat was back then, I bet she still need me\n\nThat girl is smoking\nAnd can you believe that I'm her focus?\nIt ain't hard to see she got me open\nAnd together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e1efc6d0a7044dbf2f0776a12ed85b8.620x620x1.jpg", "artist":

some bad hoes\nMr. Michael of Amish yo speaking\nFedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln\nI hear they fell in love with my penis\nOnly concerned with my balls like Venus\n\nHuh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot\nKama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top\nSay, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch\nAnd all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock\nCo-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot\nU-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop\nOn that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me\nI\u2019m still serving, broads on my TIP for gratuities\n\nThe homies say I'm

blue and brown and got that golden Gucci\nYeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me\nT.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County\nCountry accent, city fashion, lights
