As we stand on our neighborhood corner, know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have. Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front. I recognize all of you. Every creed and color. With that being said... fuck your ethnicity. You understand that? We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you. All of you...\n\nNow everybody, throw your hands up high\nIf you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high\n\nNow I don't give a fuck if you\nBlack, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit\nThat don't mean shit to me\nFuck your ethnicity, nigga\n\nFire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life\nY'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize\nYeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind\nWhat the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war\nMy details be retail, man, I got so much in store\nRacism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines\nFuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse\nThey getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick\nEverybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so I make it my business\nTo give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up\nMan, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up\nMatter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper\nThey sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras\nI mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it\nHad a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind\nSo don't you mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts\nEverybody, please hold up your wallets\nYeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?\nGoing postal, never freeze up, when I approach you\nThat's starstruck and roast you, oh my\nHiiiPower\n\nReporting live from Planet Terminator X\nI saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47\n\nNow I don't give a fuck if you\nBlack, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit\nThat don't mean shit to me\nFuck your ethnicity, nigga\n\nI'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all\nAnd you believe it? Recognize them false achievements\nIt's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off\nKnock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved\nI'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus\nI was kicking that math, dropping that science\nLike an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically I'm UFC\nIf a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien\nDon't alienate my dreams, get it right\nGet a life, I got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do\nBoy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back\nThat a plane or an angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... gross\n\nI mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you\nI'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her\nPut them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower\nAnd the power in the people and if they don't believe us\nThey'll die\nWizard\n\nNow I don't give a fuck if you\nBlack, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit\nThat don't mean shit to me\nFuck your ethnicity, nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1f3cde1d04f886d4d4eb88a2c26a4e4d.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "raw": {"annotation_count": 24, "api_path": "/songs/51797", "apple_music_id": "447516365", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/51797/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["In this opening song, Kendrick launches right into the story of Keisha and Tammy in the loose concept album ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/Kendrick-lamar/Section-80", "rel": "noopener"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/11160"}, "children": [{"tag": "em", "children": ["Section.80"]}]}, ".

think\nEverytime we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street\nShe be like:\n\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga\nFuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga\nI'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...\n\nUntil one day he wasn't acting right\nIn the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right\nWhen he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone\nMatter of fact Tyrone was on speed dial\nSo when she got home, it was going down, she go:\n\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nSick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...\n\nI know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit\nKeep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks\nWith that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist\nIn her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this\nShe be like:\n\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga\nFuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga\nI'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...\n\nUntil one day he wasn't acting right in the middle of the night\nShe checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum\nAnd the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye\nThen ran outside, then started driving on the passenger side\nHomeboy was smiling, she gon':\n\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nSick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...\n\nAnd so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up\nPut 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that\nIt was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?\nThey got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now\nCause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand\nTo lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim\nSo when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright\nThe minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they:\n\nFuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas\nFuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas\nFuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these

street\nShe be like:\n\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga\nFuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga\nI'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...\n\nUntil one day he wasn't acting right\nIn the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right\nWhen he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone\nMatter of fact Tyrone was on speed dial\nSo when she got home, it was going down, she go:\n\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nSick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...\n\nI know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit\nKeep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks\nWith that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist\nIn her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this\nShe be like:\n\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga\nFuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga\nI'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...\n\nUntil one day he wasn't acting right in the middle of the night\nShe checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum\nAnd the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye\nThen ran outside, then started driving on the passenger side\nHomeboy was smiling, she gon':\n\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nFuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga\nSick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...\n\nAnd so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up\nPut 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that\nIt was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?\nThey got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now\nCause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand\nTo lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim\nSo when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright\nThe minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they:\n\nFuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas\nFuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas\nFuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas...\n\nTammy's song"}}, {"title": "Chapter Six", "album": "Section.80", "year":

Compton Boulevard\nWith the top down, screaming \"We don't give a fuck!\"\nDrink my 40 ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt\nCause the kids just ain't alright\n\nOh, shit nigga, somethin' 'bout to happen, nigga, this shit..\nNigga this sound like 30 ki's under the Compton court building\nHope the dogs don't smell it\n\nWelcome to vigilante, 80's so don't you ask me\nI'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry\nPeelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra\nGranny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be\nYou niggas Marcus Camby, washed up\nPussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh\nYou ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane\nTake it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain\nLightnin' bolts hit your body, you thought it rained\nNot a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write\nStrong enough to stand in front of a travellin' freight train, are you trained?\nTo go against Dracula draggin' the record industry by my fangs\nAK clips, money clips and gold chains\nYou walk around with a P90 like it's the 90's\nBullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me that\n\nCompton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with\nBompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with\nCompton \u00e9ses ain't nothin' to fuck with\nBut they fuck with me, and bitch I love it\nWoop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop\nWoop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)\nWoop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop\nWoop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)\n\nLet's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check\nSpend it all on a 40-ounce to the neck and\nIn retrospect I remember December being the hottest\nSquad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas\nI tell you mothafuckas that life is full of hydraulics\nUp and down, get a 64, better know how to drive it\nI'm drivin' on E with no license or registration\nHeart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist\n1987, the children of Ronald Reagan, rake the leaves off\nYour front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)\nHe blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)\nHe copping some blow, hopin' that it can stretch\nNewborn massacre, hopping out the passenger\nWith calendars, cause your date's comin'\nRun him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough\nEven the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because\n\nCompton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with\nBompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with\nCompton \u00e9ses ain't nothin' to fuck with\nBut they fuck with me, and bitch I love it\nWoop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop\nWoop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)\nWoop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop\nWoop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)\n\nCan't detour when you're at war with your city, why run for?\nJust ride with me, just die with me, that gun store, right there\nWhen you fight, don't fight fair cause you'll never win\n\nRight, I had the yapper, and I tore they ass up\n\nCan't detour when you're at war with your city, why run for?\nJust ride with me, just die with me, that gun store, right there\nWhen you fight, don't fight fair cause you'll never win (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\nWhoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah\nWhoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah\nWhoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah\nWhoah,

used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary\nThought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me\nSince my uncles was institutionalized\nMy intuition had said I was suited for family ties\nMy momma is stressin', my daddy tired\nI need me a weapon, these niggas ride\nEvery minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me\nHow I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?\nHeaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts\nMy hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink\nYou like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga\nThe same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya\nI deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun\nAnd you'll be looking in my eyes, homie\nStand for something or fall for anything\nAnd you working with two left feet at the skating rink\nBut anyway, this for my niggas\nUncles, 23 hours sending me pictures\nI want you to know that I'm so determined to blow\nThat you hear the music I wrote\nHope it get you off Death Row\nYou came home to a pocket full of stones\nA Metro PC phone, then you went back in\nSo when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view\nI'ma get it right, just so you...\n\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\n\nAnd I do this for the city\nGot some Hennessy and my real niggas with me\nFuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me\nIf it feel good to you, holler if you hear me\n\nYou like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga\nThe same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya\nI like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya\nBe on my last dollar and split the bill with ya\nI'm 23 with morals and plans of living cordial\nNot rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me\nMy killings are not remorseful\nThe city got my back and for that I give them my torso\nYou think about it; and don't call me lyrical\n'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual\nI know some rappers using big words to make their similes curve\nMy simplest shit be more pivotal\nI penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals\nWorrisome individuals that live life critical\nSo won't you bear witness while I bare feet\nSo you can walk in my shoes and get to know me\nBut anyway, this for my pops\nOn his lunch break eating in that parking lot\nOn \"Wanna Be Heard\" probably thought he worked my nerves\nBut really he was stressing me getting what I deserved\nSomebody said my name on the radio\nHe ain't know I was ready for the world that minute\nSo the next time he roll up and drop grams in it\nHe'll probably be out of work, laid back, while he...\n\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\n\nAnd I do this for the city\nGot some Hennessy and my real niggas with me\nFuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me\nIf it feel good to you, holler if you hear me\n\nChurch is definitely on the move\nAnd now we done took it up to the cathedral\n'Cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking 'bout?\nWe out here rotating under the five P's\nProper preparation prevents poor performance\nYou know what I'm talking 'bout? Doing my thing\n'Cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping\nFrom the Windy City streets all the way out here\nTo the streets of Compton, know what I'm talking 'bout?\nChurch is definitely on the move\nAnd we gonna continue to hustle and grow and develop by far\nAs I rotate with my true player partner\nBy the name of Kendrick Lamar, you know what I'm talking 'bout?\nThis is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout?\nYou gotta get up off your ass and get it, man\nThat's the only way your pockets gonna expand\nI tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?\nApply yourself to supply your wealth\nOnly limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yo'self\nChurch is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking 'bout?\nExercise your ism, and don't depend on no one else\nCathedral, church, \"ism\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1f3cde1d04f886d4d4eb88a2c26a4e4d.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "raw": {"annotation_count": 27, "api_path": "/songs/51806", "apple_music_id": "447516789", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/51806/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["The title, \u201cPoe Man\u2019s Dreams,\u201d is a play on the Southern pronunciation of \u2018poor,\u2019 but also alludes to the classic American writer ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Edgar-allan-poe", "rel": "noopener"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/21094"}, "children": ["Edgar Allen Poe"]}, ".

good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\n\nI used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary\nThought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me\nSince my uncles was institutionalized\nMy intuition had said I was suited for family ties\nMy momma is stressin', my daddy tired\nI need me a weapon, these niggas ride\nEvery minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me\nHow I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?\nHeaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts\nMy hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink\nYou like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga\nThe same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya\nI deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun\nAnd you'll be looking in my eyes, homie\nStand for something or fall for anything\nAnd you working with two left feet at the skating rink\nBut anyway, this for my niggas\nUncles, 23 hours sending me pictures\nI want you to know that I'm so determined to blow\nThat you hear the music I wrote\nHope it get you off Death Row\nYou came home to a pocket full of stones\nA Metro PC phone, then you went back in\nSo when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view\nI'ma get it right, just so you...\n\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\n\nAnd I do this for the city\nGot some Hennessy and my real niggas with me\nFuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me\nIf it feel good to you, holler if you hear me\n\nYou like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga\nThe same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya\nI like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya\nBe on my last dollar and split the bill with ya\nI'm 23 with morals and plans of living cordial\nNot rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me\nMy killings are not remorseful\nThe city got my back and for that I give them my torso\nYou think about it; and don't call me lyrical\n'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual\nI know some rappers using big words to make their similes curve\nMy simplest shit be more pivotal\nI penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals\nWorrisome individuals that live life critical\nSo won't you bear witness while I bare feet\nSo you can walk in my shoes and get to know me\nBut anyway, this for my pops\nOn his lunch break eating in that parking lot\nOn \"Wanna Be Heard\" probably thought he worked my nerves\nBut really he was stressing me getting what I deserved\nSomebody said my name on the radio\nHe ain't know I was ready for the world that minute\nSo the next time he roll up and drop grams in it\nHe'll probably be out of work, laid back, while he...\n\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\nSmoke good, eat good, live good\n\nAnd I do this for the city\nGot some Hennessy and my real niggas with me\nFuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me\nIf it feel good to you, holler if you hear me\n\nChurch is definitely on the move\nAnd now we

masculine, some of them feminine\n'member the universe used to be innocent\nNow they just look at us crazy like immigrants\nEveryday that I wake up, I'mma sin again\nI'm not a citizen, I'm just a

usuals leaving her body sore\nShe take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles\nLipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more\nShe play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper\nBumping \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" while a pervert yelling at her\nAnd she capture features of a woman, but only 17\nThen seven cars start honking\nShe start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow\nIf they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go\nAnd sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars\nShe give it all to her daddy but she don't know her father\nThat's ironic\nSee, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked\nAnd in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where\nNothing really matters, so she hit the back seat\nRosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet\n\nFancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard\nFlagging down all of these flashy cars\n\nAnd Lord knows she's beautiful\nLord knows the usuals leaving her body sore\nHer anatomy is God's temple\nAnd it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed\nShe's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets\nUndercovers the dummies that look like decoys\nRemember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen\nWhat's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise\nShe took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him\nA warm welcome that filled him right below the navel\nThough he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables\nHis eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em\nIt was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked\nAnd in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind\nShe made it where nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat\n'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police\n\nFancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard\nFlagging down all of these flashy cars\n\nAnd Lord knows she's beautiful\nLord knows the usuals leaving her body sore\nAs she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour\nShe suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure\nOf a black man, white man, needing satisfaction\nAt first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it\nSometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it\nBut she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption\nThat sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother\nFor letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover\n10 months before she was 10 he moved in\nAnd that's when he touched her\nThis mothafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing to that\nBlock away from Lueders Park\nI seen the El Camino park\nAnd in her heart she hate it there but in her mind\nShe made it where nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat\nThen caught a knife inside the bladder\nLeft for dead, raped in the street\nKeisha's song\n\nMy little sister 11, I looked her right in the face\nThe day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play\n\nFancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard\nFlagging down all of these flashy cars\nFancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard, oh\nFlagging down all of these flashy cars"}}, {"title": "Rigamortis", "album": "Section.80", "year": "2011-07-02", "lyrics": "Alright, here we go, third take\nReal quick, Ali, mm\n\nGot me

Enlighten me\nIs you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?\nIt's fire in the street, fire in my Swisher\nFire in between the two legs of your lil' sister\nJust get a sip of this elixir\nBefore they crop us out of the picture\nI've never seen a crop circle\nBut I've seen cops circle the block\nI puff squares, but I swear, one day, I'ma stop\nMy nerves itch\nOn the brink of my career\nWhile my peers struggle for employment\nCan you hear these screams?\n(Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me) One, two\nThree four grams and a fifth of Hennessy\nA bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary\nSection 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan\nWe raising hell, hell (Oh)\nLord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in\nThe president is black, but you can't vote for skin\nYou vote for the better man\nCome to our show, you can see the diversity\nUnify the people, they gon' peep it universally\nWe might not change the world\nBut we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'\nAyo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?\nWe knew we'd be here, like, back in 04'\nStarted HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator\nIn a system meant to disintegrate us (Ooh!)\nAnd all we do is assist them\nWe're not victors, we're victims\nThe bigger picture isn't developed yet\nLike, what if Keisha was celibate?\nOr what if Tammy came across a real man\nWho didn't play games like children?\nMy nigga cheated on his girlfriend\nWith his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end\nAnd everybody tripping off 2012\nAnd the extraterrestrial presence as well\n(Odd Future's aight) But our future is not\nThat martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got\nSo keep that question mark on your face\nEat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste\nHide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine to five\nDon't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive\nHiiiPower\nAnd on another note\nWe focused like the Hubble Telescope\nSoul!\n\nLife is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam\nI'm ready to go, ready to go\nLife is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam\nReady to go, ready to go\nLife is a traffic jam\nLife...\n\nI wrote this because I was ordered to\nPeople say I speak for generation Y\nWhy lie, I do, Section 80\nYour son will play me if the radio won't\nDaughters that just turn 1 'til 21 listen to Kendrick\nFor instance:\nWhat's your life about? Enlighten me\nIs you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?\nTake out that student loan, and pay off your college degree\nAnd do exactly what you see on TV\nTrue story!\nHmm\nCan you repeat that for me, Soul?\nWhat's your life about? Enlighten me\nIs you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?\nIs you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?\nThe time is now, my child, come on\nSee, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar\nBecause you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence\nYou know what all the things have in common?\nOnly half of the truth, if you tell it\nSee I spent 23 years on the earth searching for answers\n'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own\nI'm not on the outside looking in\nI'm not on the inside looking out\nI'm in the dead fucking center, looking around\nYou ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?\nThat's an analogy for the way the world make me react\nMy innocence been dead\nSo, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence\nJust know I meant it, and you felt it\n'Cause you too are searching for answers\nI'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper\nI am a human motherfucking being over dope-ass instrumentation\nKendrick Lamar!\nNow fuck 'em up, Terrace!\n(Soul!)\n\n\nI watch this fire that we\u2019re gathered around\nAnd see that it burns similar to the fire that\u2019s inside you\nSection.80\nSection.80 babies\nA generation of bliss and disobedience\nKnow they can't control us\nKnow they can't control you\nKnow they can't control us\nBut we can control each other\nWe build our own world\nIf you don't leave with nothing else tonight\nYou will leave with knowing yourself\nYou will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us\nOur family\nHeart, honor, and respect\nThis is you\nThis is me\nAnd we are HiiiPower"}}, {"title": "HiiiPoWeR", "album": "Section.80", "year": "2011-04-12",

me\nMalcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me\nI'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone\nBack to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone\nYou slipped your disc when I slid you my disc\nYou wanted to diss but jumped on my dick\nGrown men never should bite their tongue\nUnless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum\nI got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol\nAiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you\nMy issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise\nHow to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental\nThis is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it\nYou'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it\nAnd everything on TV just a figment of imagination\nI don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian\nWhile you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship\nBuilding pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs\n\nJust call the shit HiiiPoWeR\nNigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR\nFive-star dishes, food for thought, bitches\nI mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid\nYou can't resist his HiiiPoWeR\nThrow your hands up for HiiiPoWeR\n\nVisions of Martin Luther staring at me\nIf I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy\nSorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek\nThey wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh\nAnd she always told me pray for the weak, uhh\nThem demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh\nDear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard\nHe probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs\nFrightening, so fucking frightening\nEnough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill\nI'm standing on the field full of land mines\nDoing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time\nCause 2012 might not be a fucking legend\nTryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind\nWho said a black man in the Illuminati?\nLast time I checked, that was the biggest racist party\nSo get up off that slave ship\nBuild your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs\n\nJust call the shit HiiiPoWeR\nNigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR\nFive-star dishes, food for thought, bitches\nI mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals\nYou can't resist his HiiiPoWeR\nThrow your hands up for HiiiPoWeR\n\nEvery day we fight the system just to make our way\nWe been down for too long, but that's alright\nWe was built to be strong, cause it's our life, na-na-na\nEvery day we fight the system, we fight the system\nWe fight the system (Never like the system)\nWe been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na\n\nWho said a black man in the Illuminati?\nLast time I checked, that was the biggest racist party\nLast time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey\nOn the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi\nAnd I want everybody to view my autopsy\nSo you can see exactly where the government had shot me\nNo conspiracy, my fate is inevitable\nThey play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal\nFrightening, so fucking frightening\nEnough to drive a man insane, a woman insane\nThe reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain\nLoaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy\nProduct of the late 80's\nTryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy\nPull your guns and play me, let's set it off\nCause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost\nCause we been off them slave ships\nGot our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs\n\nJust call the shit HiiiPoWeR\nYeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR\nFive-star dishes, food for thought,

Thug Life!"}}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
