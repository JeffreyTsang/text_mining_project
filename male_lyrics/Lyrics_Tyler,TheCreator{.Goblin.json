What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on\n\nI'm not a fucking role model (I know this)\nI'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams\nSince Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit\nThese mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit\nI'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless\nBut getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)\nPhilly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares\nAt skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird\nYonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked\nNow competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked\nHe still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)\nBut that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it\nAnd a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy\nA couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cooking\nThem nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat\nBastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?\n\n\"Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual\"\n\"Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied\"\n\"You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine\"\n\"I try too hard, huh?\"\n\"No, you don't\"\n\nMade a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet\nThe 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set\nNigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity\nI'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity\nOh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper\nCause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?\nI'm the star of the group (Yeah)\nSo no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you\n(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?\nTo have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?\nLike I didn't make \"Parade\" or \"Inglorious\"\nCause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?\nOf course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off\nIn the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)\nMessage boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here)\nLet me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor\n\n\"Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?\"\n\"I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that.\"\n\"I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now.\"\n\"Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time at your home?\"\n\"What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?\"\n\"I have, I mean you're a great person.\"\n\"I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?\"\n\nPeople excited, thinking shit is so tight (For what?)\nGetting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like\nWhat the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?\nAnd start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)\nFuck that, (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me\nCause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique\nAnd all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak\nOn the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week\nI'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T\nAnd some Waka Flocka Flame instead (All that shit) of that real hip hop\nThat's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique\nEverything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released\nBut they don't get it, (They don't, it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them\nThe nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him\nBut they do not have the mindset that's same as him\nI'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him\n\n\"It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that \"faggot\" word, that's very, that's a bad...\n\"I'm not homophobic.\"\n\"I mean, I don't think you are but...\"\n\"Faggot.\"\n\"Alright, well, since the last time we...\"\n\"The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can.\"\n\"I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts, just.. I mean, they're really random and it's ADD.\"\n\"Who doesn't have ADD..? Well, I don't.\"\n\"I mean, sometimes, you're just really out in the distance and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?\"\n\"I wish Thebe was here.\"\n\nTherapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended\nThey don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion\nYou see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen\nHere, put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)\nWhen someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (What?) his AK-47\nAt 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned\n(I don't think anyone's going to men\u2014I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.)\nCollege wasn't working and I wasn't working\nSo I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting\nBut I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait\nCause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit (I mean, you...)\nNow I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight\nAnd can afford to get my mother something on her birthday\n(I mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, I mean, I...)\nThey claim the shit I say is just wrong\nLike nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone\nI'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone\nMy life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now\nWow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen\nAnd when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians\n(So, what are you saying, take advantage?\nI mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that)\nI still live in my grandma's house\nSell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches\nI hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement\nMy hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then\nAnd then I am confused if I want in or just out\nMy friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling\nI sit in grandmother's living room and just pout\nAnd shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (No, you don't)\nOdd Future came from the bottom\nAnd it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em\n(I believe you) All you fucking lames don't have to like me\nThe devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee\n\nWhoa, umm, alright, uh, so Syd was telling me you went to New York...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fd29e400e2d672aa992f9fda170e9959.640x640x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 27, "api_path": "/songs/49610", "apple_music_id": "433409588", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/49610/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["The opening titular track from ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/posts/Tyler-the-creator-goblin", "rel": "noopener"}, "children": ["Tyler The Creator\u2019s ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Goblin"]}]}, " album, his follow up to ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/Tyler-the-creator/Bastard", "rel": "noopener"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/10761"}, "children": [{"tag": "em", "children": ["Bastard"]}]}, "."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["The raps are inter-cut with dialogue between Tyler and his therapist/alter-ego/conscience Dr. TC.

Flintstone\nMaking crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones\nThis nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown\nAbout five, seven of his bitches in my bedroom\nSwallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sin and

(Cool)\nGreen paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers\nAll I want \u2013 fuck money, diamonds, and bitches; don't need 'em\nBut where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em\nIt's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em\nSnap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves\nIt's been a couple months\nAnd Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave\nDamn\n\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\nGoddamn goblin\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\n\nThey say success is the best revenge\nSo I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in\nOh, not again! Another critic writing report\nI'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork\nStill suicidal, I am\nI'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand\nI'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head\nAnd I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch\n(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G\nI just wanna know if my father would ever like me\nBut I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me\nA motherfuckin' goblin\n(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said\nThen it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead\nNow the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement\nActions speak louder than words, let me try this shit\nDead"}}, {"title": "Radicals", "album": "Goblin", "year": "2011-05-10", "lyrics": "Random disclaimer!\nHey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay?\nIt's fucking fiction\nIf anything happens, don't fucking blame me\nWhite America, fuck Bill O'Reilly\nFour, three, two, one\n\nWhat the fuck I look like?

I overheard\nA sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na\nRolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow\nBlood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash\nLooked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass\nA real ninja, with the blade and the mask\nHad them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks\nNow she tryna patch me up, but\nGirl, I was just tryna get a nut bust\nIf that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol\nBut I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude\n\nThe blinds wide open so he can\nSee you in the dark when you're sleepin'\nNaked body, fresh out the shower\nYou touch yourself after hours\nAin't no man allowed in your bedroom\nYou're sleeping alone in bed\nBut check your window (Swag)\nHe's at your window\n\nNight light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites\nI'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right\nYou'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight\nBut I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight\nWe can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck\nYou can tell me all your problems like I really give one\nBut I give two for us cause you're the one that I want\nDon't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy\nSee when I'm with my friends I just put on a front\nBut in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we\nWe, as including I, and yourself, making three\nLittle ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me\nYou're a pretty broad in the top three\nOf things that I've been waiting to come, so\nMeet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then\nWe can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time\n\nThe blinds wide open so he can\nSee you in the dark when you're sleepin'\nNaked body, fresh out the shower\nYou touch yourself after hours\nAin't no man allowed in your bedroom\nYou're sleeping alone in bed\nBut check your window\nHe's at your window\n\nOne, two; you're the girl that I want\nThree, four, five, six, seven; shit\nEight is the bullets if you say no after all this\nAnd I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous\nGorgeous, baby you're gorgeous\nI just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest\nAnd fornicate with it\nBut that's because I'm in love with you, cunt\n\nI just wanna talk, and conversate\n'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate\nAnd I finally got the courage to ask you on a date\nSo just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)\nI just wanna talk, and conversate\n'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate\nAnd I finally got the courage to ask you on a date\nSo just say yes, let the future

I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some\nMy father called me to tell me he loved me\u2014\nI'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me\nAnnoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me\nI'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me\nFeel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all\nI'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant\nIgnorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it\nBecause I am the devil, fucker, get on my level\nDoughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers\nMy life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker\nI'll see you in a couple, OF\n\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your day dreams, that's how death seems\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your daydreams, that's how death seems\n\nTyler, here's some water, man. You seem a little tense. How's Thebe?\n\nAll because a nigga just don't give a fuck\nParents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up\nBut fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up\nThat's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh\nFeel like I missed my little brother growing up\nFeel like my little brother missed his brother growing up\nBut this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up\nI got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh\nNow I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up\nBut I never had a drink\u2014 (Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!)\nMy nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough\nI won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up\nBut that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm\nAs emotionally straight as Travis when he--(Tyler, calm down)\nDon't look at me, I'm 6'5\", about to fucking cry\nAbout another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die\nI finally had a family\nDomo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?\nNow you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me\nBut before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?\nFuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death\nOne ear I got kids screaming, \"O.F. is the best\"\nThe other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at\nSo I can kill these levels of stress, shit\nThey say that I'm shock value\nHow about you hop off cock and turn volume down?\nI haven't got around to telling my mom shit (why?)\nCause I don't know how to...(whoa)\nAll I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home\nWhen mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown\nNow she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown\nAnd hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone\nLooking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone\nThen they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack\nFor the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees\nAnd deodorant like his house is my home\nI could live with the same hat\nAnd the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack\nAnd the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday\nWhere I skate with the same fucking friends that\nDidn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh\n\"Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat\"\nEmail full of emails, I never write back\nAin't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back\n\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your day dreams, that's how death seems\n\nOne shot, two shots, one gun, two cops\nI'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers\nYou're on the side of faggots and cock blockers\nI'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches\nI'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human\nCause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys\nYou niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that\nWe at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)\nNigga, get off me\n\n(Calm down, man)\nFuck off me man, fuck (what's gotten into you?)\nI don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times\nSometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (yeah, you...)\nIt's like I got a fucking voice in my head\nTelling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)\nI don't fucking know, man (what's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)\nHe tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do (what's his name?)\nTron Cat", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fd29e400e2d672aa992f9fda170e9959.640x640x1.jpg",

off...\n\nMy only problem is death\nFuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect\nBrain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret\nTalking to me is like a fucking body missing a neck\nBut, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off\nLife is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked\nMy hands tremble, my finger slipped, the wall's red\nHer life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead\n\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your day dreams, that's how death seems\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your daydreams, that's how death seems\n\nWhen I was younger, I would smile a lot\nI'm getting older, getting bolder, but a wiser top\nNow I'm drunk driving, lap's full of Budweiser tops\nLife is a movie and you're just a prop\nThey begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums\nLove? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some\nMy father called me to tell me he loved me\u2014\nI'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me\nAnnoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me\nI'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me\nFeel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all\nI'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant\nIgnorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it\nBecause I am the devil, fucker, get on my level\nDoughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers\nMy life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker\nI'll see you in a couple, OF\n\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your day dreams, that's how death seems\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your daydreams, that's how death seems\n\nTyler, here's some water, man. You seem a little tense. How's Thebe?\n\nAll because a nigga just don't give a fuck\nParents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up\nBut fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up\nThat's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh\nFeel like I missed my little brother growing up\nFeel like my little brother missed his brother growing up\nBut this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up\nI got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh\nNow I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up\nBut I never had a drink\u2014 (Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!)\nMy nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough\nI won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up\nBut that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm\nAs emotionally straight as Travis when he--(Tyler, calm down)\nDon't look at me, I'm 6'5\", about to fucking cry\nAbout another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die\nI finally had a family\nDomo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?\nNow you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me\nBut before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?\nFuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death\nOne ear I got kids screaming, \"O.F. is the best\"\nThe other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at\nSo I can kill these levels of stress, shit\nThey say that I'm shock value\nHow about you hop off cock and turn volume down?\nI haven't got around to telling my mom shit (why?)\nCause I don't know how to...(whoa)\nAll I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home\nWhen mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown\nNow she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown\nAnd hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone\nLooking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone\nThen they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack\nFor the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees\nAnd deodorant like his house is my home\nI could live with the same hat\nAnd the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack\nAnd the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday\nWhere I skate with the same fucking friends that\nDidn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh\n\"Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat\"\nEmail full of emails, I never write back\nAin't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back\n\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your day dreams, that's how death seems\n\nOne shot, two shots, one gun, two cops\nI'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers\nYou're on the side of faggots and cock blockers\nI'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches\nI'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human\nCause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys\nYou niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that\nWe at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)\nNigga, get off me\n\n(Calm down, man)\nFuck off me man, fuck (what's gotten into you?)\nI don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times\nSometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (yeah, you...)\nIt's like I got a fucking voice in my head\nTelling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)\nI don't fucking know, man (what's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)\nHe tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do (what's his name?)\nTron Cat"}}, {"title": "Tron Cat", "album": "Goblin", "year": "2011-05-10", "lyrics": "La, la, la, la, la, la, la\nAAAAHHH!\n\nSatan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us\nBooks on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)\nWolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers\nAnd young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us\nYou niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head\nInstead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads\nWhile you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead\nBodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby\nI'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist\nI fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit\nBrag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter\nThen proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox\nAtta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore\nTorture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store\nThis the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore\nThat make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours\n(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience\nGot a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian\nAfter chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went\nI want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick\nI make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose\nGame of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose\nShe running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose\nUntil I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops\nVictim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one\nHoney on that topping when I stuff you in my system\nRape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome\nYou got a fucking death wish?

wolves, the demons say they preferring us\nBooks on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)\nWolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers\nAnd young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us\nYou niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head\nInstead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads\nWhile you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead\nBodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby\nI'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist\nI fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit\nBrag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter\nThen proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox\nAtta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore\nTorture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store\nThis the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore\nThat make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours\n(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience\nGot a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian\nAfter chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went\nI want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick\nI make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose\nGame of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose\nShe running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose\nUntil I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops\nVictim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one\nHoney on that topping when I stuff you in my system\nRape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome\nYou got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done\nNice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you\nWith a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup\nBitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches\nRubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker\nJeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her\nIn the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper\nTake her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed\nFilled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands\nPut her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics\nStare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric\nPut her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek\nSatan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust\nAnd snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick\nHippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders\nGave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer\nThey will never catch him or catch up\nThey asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup\nNutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum\nOdd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yep\nThis the type of shit that make children break in apartments\nWhen you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin\n(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover\nWhere I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder\nStore her in a portable freezer with me to Portland\nCatch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)\nI'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water\nCause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter\n(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins\nSicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing\nOdd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah\nWith your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister\nEvident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick\nI got these cracker doctors saying, \"yeah Bob, this nigga's sick\"\nAnimal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry\nBecause I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie\nI don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches\nI said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes\nI plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma\nBeing the only bastard in a box logo casket\nRashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets\nIn some Kanye West glasses screaming out \"fuck faggots\"\nCatch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick\nDrop the beat here to make it extra climactic\n\nWhat the fuck?\nI... I'm speechless, that was... fuck\nShit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help\nI'm not a... fuck it, different subject\nHow's that girl you were telling me about?"}}, {"title": "Her", "album": "Goblin", "year": "2011-05-10", "lyrics": "Oh I don't need the metronome bro\n(Ey)\nWhen you wanna be, ahh\nWhen you eat all the cheese in the store\nIn the the store, in the store, in the store, yeah, yeah yeah\nAlright\n\n(It's this girl)\nShe lives next door, to the store that I loiter at\nWe talk every night, she cry to me about her guy\nAnd if we text I get pissed when I get no reply\n(It's this girl)\nI know that she's the key to love\nShe is who I'm thinking of when I am beating Richard up\nTo mental images her face look\nThe closest that I got was when I'm poking her on Facebook\n(This girl)\nVideo chats are so exciting\n'Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy\nI'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me\nShe's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate (arrrrgh!)\n(It's this girl)\nI see her in class\nNot really, two doors down, but anytime that I pass\nTo take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall\nLocking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick\nMy left hand on her tits, ah my shit's getting hard\nFrom thoughts of dating this bitch\n(It's this girl)\nHer name is my password, fuck\n(This girl)\n\nAll my niggas got they bitches and stuff\nBut all the bitches they fuck, are known as bitches and sluts\nAnd she's special, I know to y'all I come off as rough\nBut I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur\nA relation, I want the cheesy dates at the movies\nAnd stupid walks at the beach, and sharing straws in a cup\nI never had that, so when we holding hands walking home\nI look past that, the fact that she's fucking guys that I hate\n(This girl)\nBut, things are looking great, cut copy\nLast time we talked she said that her relationship was rocky (Action)\nNow that Mr. Faggot's gone, there's no one that can stop me\nFrom bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy\n(Girl)\nNext day, metro's taking me home\nI see her in the cut at Wendy's, but she's not alone\nWho's that guy?

shrink\nStarted with the link\nContended her to meet me at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink\nWe was uniquely in sync\nAlready fuckin' and we only met last week\nWe were both young, not yet antique\nSo her mindset was working for my technique\nTell her that I love her and by next week\nYou can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks\nNo, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep\nThe neighbors by the creek says my house stinks\nAnd it reeks on the sheet, girl\nStreaks of red, even though all pussy is pink\nOblivion makes obvious seeks\nWhich make meats for my obvious feasts\nUsed to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink\nNow I get daughters and tie 'em and clink\nGot my dick harder than iron and zinc\nNow they just rot up, arms caught in the sink\nWhere they get cut up to fit my physique\nCritique my chic in this brand new mink, go\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, ohh (Fish!)\nOh, oh\nOh, ohh\n(Yeah) Oh, oh (Wolf Gang)\n(Wolf Haley) Oh, ohh (How you doin'?)\n(All good?) Oh, oh (Cool)\n(We cool?) Oh, ohh (I'm upset)\n\nBitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip\nMake her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip\nTyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit\nRound trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket\nFilm clips popping on that Canon\nBusting Ottoman cannons, on the pill\nIs he real? Gaza stripping (In my living room)\nWolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms (Mushrooms)\nI'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon\nThis fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, ohh (Fish!)\nOh, oh\nOh, ohh\n\n(Frankie, Frankie)\nNow I'd like to take this time of day\nTo thank the Mother Earth (Thank you Momma, thank you Momma, fish!)\nLetting the sun shine down on the lake\nWhile I fish your waters\nOoh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters\nHell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)\n'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool\nHe on the loose, yeah (Yeah)\n\nGot to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait\nWait 'til you see the semen swimming\nBaby, please not half, the whole is great\nMorals? Your body's near that coral reef\nIt was once upon a time you came home with me\nThen the next chapter left you in my teeth\nFill your gills with goo\nGoing deeper than Pacific Ocean\nThis specific motion\nMakes this hammerhead puke\nGot to wear a wetsuit, can\u2019t get seasick\nI love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you\nYou\u2019re fucking wet, fish\n\n\nSo I met this girl at the club\nAnd I just wanted her to suck my dick\nAnd that's 'cause\nShe a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch\nNow she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot\nUntil we go to another room\nAnd that's 'cause\nShe a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin'\n\nThis little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks\nThan them other sluts fuck for, real easy\nCause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy\nI used the welcome mat as a cum rag\nAnd all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she\u2019s a cum bag\nFilled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store\nFour more Dora-looking sluts let me explore\nUntil my cock got sore and started growing cold sores\n\nNow she thinks that I like her\nBut all I really wanted was that mouth\nAnd that's 'cause\nShe a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch\nNow she text messages me every day\nAnd I don't ever hit that bitch back\nAnd that's because\nShe a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch (That's right), she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'\n\nThis little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap\nUntil my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped\nFlapping up and down until the cack finally go splat\nNow you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat\nThen you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings\nYou wasn\u2019t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling\nNow shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with\n\nNow, now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')\nWait, tell him why we can\u2019t fuck with this bitch, y'all? (That bitch she boppin')\nWhat is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')\nShe, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')\n\nNow I'm at a fuckin' clinic\n'Cause my dick is swollen and keeps itchin'\nNigga, I'ma kill this bitch (She's a boppin' bitch)\nBitch (She a boppin' bitch)\nShe a boppin' bitch\n\nWhere's my gun? (She boppin') I'ma kill this bitch\nWhy am I gon' kill this bitch?\nTo all my niggas out there listenin', that bitch (She's boppin')\nAnd don't let her suck your dick or you'll get hurt"}}, {"title":

not gon' smoke, but I'm just asking baby; \u0441ould you meet me by the lake?\nSaid bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake\nBathing suit, it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake\nWe could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?\nSummer never has to end with me\n\nI'm give it to her, she wants that summer time\nI'm give it like no other cause she knows I'm hers\nDamn right she's mine, we both know it\nSo when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse\nDamn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga\nCome for mines in summer time, I'ma bust that trigger, nigga\nCatch us Venice beachin', she wanna go shopping\nSun down after club cause she like to get it popping\nSangria on my freedmind, cause she likes to get it popping\nNo ecstasy for her, but she wanna get it popping\nDrop topping, I measure her pleasure\nThen drop in, when she get out of place I quantinize\nShe is my concubine, I am her porcupine\nI poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind\nI know her analyzation, so when she try to fake\nSummer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake\n\nI can grab the fireworks, and soda, all the cookies we could eat\nMake you nauseous, but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek\nWe could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth\nI'm not gon' smoke, but I'm just asking baby; \u0441ould you meet me by the lake?\nSaid bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake\nBathing suit, it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake\nWe could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?\nSummer never has to end with me\n\nI packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket\nAnd brought some extra towels if anyone was asking\nWe should take a dip in that lake quick and then split\nThen do something that's beyond what we both can imagine\n\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, grab a drink\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, look in the sky\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, we never have to leave\nWatch the sunset (There goes a rainbow)\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (We can stay here)\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (All night long)\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset\nWatch the sunset (There goes a rainbow)\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (Look)\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset\nWatch the sunset (Let's go to sleep)\nWe're here, all night, school is in session\nLook, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep"}},

talk to you\nBecause, they're really worried about you\nI thought it would be better if, they could talk to you\n\nIt was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines\nWhen I rhyme, I'm tryna get pictures in High Times\nSmoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the skyline\nSwanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime\nIn my mind, I'm just tryna smoke the finest\nAnd get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas\nI'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit\nI am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this\nI'm a stoner, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get the picture now\n30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down\nAnother flight, another beat, another city, wow\nThus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out\nWhere we at? We on top of the world\n\nAnd five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park\nI walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back\nHurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs\nAll was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact\nBunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat\nTeenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it\nHad a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Bimmer almost black\nParked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at\nEarl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel\nSydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt\nBet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back\nWe live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat\nDeep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's where I'm at\nNow where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?\n\nSwell motions get promotions, to my whole team\nHell yeah, I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green\nProfessor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed\nShine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds\nWe at Randy's ordering that 306\nMilk and glaze is the greed gold mix me\nYour bitch is coming along, yeah, she hum to my song\nSinging like they were for her, but they were for the blur\nNo longer, but we were in premature, immature\nShe's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt\nOn the floor then pick it up, out the door, door\nChased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption\nImpregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion\nWhere we at? We on top of the world\n\nEverything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing\nNow, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend\nAlways been the most cool, they chase our shade\nThey say life switches pace when you got shit made\nSo I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days\nWhen your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane\nAnd too often they think that they could stop me\nNow every show we makin' half a Maserati\nAnd the only thing blocking me is paparazzi\nNow it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me\nEverything stays in the box like fighters in hockey\nMiss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard\nI got the world saying every single Friday is black\nTook your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know\nWhere we at nigga? We on top of the world\n\nWhere we at, niggas?\nWhere the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh\nWhere we at?\n\nDown to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh\nFuck everybody, here goes some extra girth, Sir\nYou fucking critics are making my nerves hurt\nSince I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert\nMy window is a book and I'm a fucking crook\nStealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook\nMy mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either\nI ain't signed a fucking deal yet\nBut when I do, Clancy and Dave are taking percentages\nThat could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage\nHopefully, I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon\nFrom playing piano organs and hopefully, I can pay the bill\nShit is getting real, people begin to feel\nLike I'm changing, but their complaining, making big fucking deals\nAbout some shit, they bitch and pout\nCan we get backstage, man? No, faggot, it's sold out\nCome on, why you holding out? I thought we was boys\nWithout me, you wouldn't be Tyler, The Creator, you're from the Dirty\nI can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots\nBut I'm a fucking unicorn Whatever, man\nLook, you can't stop me, I'm going full Monty\nFuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi\nWolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be\nAnd I be where, anybody cares\nI try to preach \"Fuck age, live dreams and have fun\"\nHere\u2019s some give a fuck cake Oh, maybe I should have some\nAsshole, have none\nHow can I wake up on the wrong side of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?\nWhen I'm on that stage, I feel important\nA whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin\nBecause the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him\nYou gotta be fucking kidding me\nIn school, I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it\nYou can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah, I'm rebel nigga\nCheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit\nOkay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building"}}, {"title": "AU79", "album": "Goblin", "year": "2011-05-10", "lyrics": "", "image":

this is... this is the end of this session, let's... anything else you've gotta say?\"\n\nMom is getting jealous, I see my manager more\nThan I see her before I go on tour and it hurts (Yeah)\nI miss the days when this was fun, but now it turned into work\nAnd getting legal, so I got to watch the shit that I blurt out (As you should, that shit's outrageous...)\nMy friends are turning into opposites\nBecause my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist\nAnd all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick\nHarder than the white kids who copy shit\nEnding it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about\nAll alone, bawling 'til my motherfucking eyes bleed\nSee, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting\nWhen there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man, fuck\n(I'm here to talk to you) I'm putting myself at a distance\nFor instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant (Who, Travis?)\nNiggas saying \"Free Earl\" without

will end up in a sticky blast\nChrissy Brown, mask on my face, now I'm kicking ass\nLife's a bitch, fuck college, mommy, I am ditching class\nI rather be happy than fucking forty\nSo fuck the

box\nOh stop, tryna be me, kids will go cop anything\nThat I put on from the gold watch to the boxers that I put on\nProbably cause I'm goin harder than erect cock dick filled with Botox\nOh shit, you're as hard as senior citizens dick\nOh fuck, don't slip, break hips and pop backs\nShow some respect to old chaps with my left fist\nCause I'm the next best spitting wreck thats left here\nThat's my ex bitch\nHer? She's my next bitch\nHave you met her mouth? No? Oh that's my bestest\nBestie, and she gets beastie\nAnd she's my favorite babysitter cause the children never exit\nI was taught to act my shoe size, I'm eleven and a half\nCock the umbrella cause when I spit Seven on your ass\nIt's gonna be mid stage Coachella\nShake's faggot ass keep hatin'\nBut I work hard for the shit that I got\nSo it's still fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Planet Earth\nAll associates can suck cock"}}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
