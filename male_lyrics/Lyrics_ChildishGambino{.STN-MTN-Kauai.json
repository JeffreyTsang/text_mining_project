I fire all the cops in Cobb county\nChick-Fil-A will be open on Sundays\nI bring back LaFace Records, Freaknik, Kilo Ali, Lou\nI get J.R. Crickets some Spelman girls with big booties\nI reopen SciTrek, strippers will get Mother's Day off\nAnd I'd have my own Gangsta Grillz mixtape\n\n\nHey, this is Steve Smith from American Dad\nAnd this is Royalty\n(Stone Mountain)\n\nThis what y'all been waiting for?\nIn Gambino we trust!

Why young guy? Why so generous?\n\nI ain't no snitch, cops I don't trust 'em\nI ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em (It's Royalty!)\nNigga, I was stuntin', keep that shit a hunnid\nIf it ain't about the money then it's not up for discussion\nIf it ain't about progress, ain't about success\nWhy this nigga suspect?

Friday\nAnd they played me real loud on the street\nWe drive up Memorial Drive, up Wesley Chapel\nI reopen 112, and Jazzy T's\nI'd bring back Turner Field. I fire all the cops in Cobb county\nChick-Fil-A will be open on Sundays\nI bring back LaFace Records, Freaknik, Kilo Ali, Lou\nI get J.R. Crickets some Spelman girls with big booties\nI reopen SciTrek, strippers will get Mother's Day off\nAnd I'd have my own Gangsta Grillz mixtape\n\n\nHey, this is Steve Smith from American Dad\nAnd this is Royalty\n(Stone Mountain)\n\nThis what y'all been waiting for?\nIn Gambino we trust!

time for your short money!\n\nTwo gold chains and I still don't never wear 'em\nWhy would I wear 'em? Cheese like a camera\nSpendin' money son a bitch nigga like Sanford\nI'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like 'Damn, I'm so handsome'\nIf it ain't 'bout that money, why a young god answer?\nGhost on my wrist (wrist), got me so Casper\nFlow so cold, watch them haters get asthma\nAnd every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one\n\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\n\nThree cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em\nWhy would I call 'em?  Bitch you know I'm ballin'\nSpendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding (Swish)\nGot a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans\nAnd he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin'\nAll my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy\nRap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy\nI got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi\n\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\n\nYoung Bino, we be mobbin'\nYou don't see me, I'm on an island\nThese haters left us no choice\nLeave the trap like so moist\nLittle rock like dope boys\nOh my God, I'm out of fucks\nColombian but she ain't a plug\nThat's racist\nIn '96 I had K-swiss\nYou 96 with some fake bitch\nAnd I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language\nHead game so Cambridge\nGod damn, you dirty...\nYou were lettin' me bust in it\nBut if they ask I plead the fifth\n\nOk this the part where I need ya'll to make it bounce like Spalding\nMake it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding\nMake it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding\nMake it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding\nMake it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding\nGot a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans\n\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk"}}, {"title": "Money Baby", "album": "STN MTN / Kauai", "year": "2014-10-03", "lyrics": "(Dramatic nigga!)\nStone Mountain\nChildish\nDram (Gangsta grizzle!)\n\nI like smokin' loud, I like being me\nI might drop them bars, that AT&T\nI like makin' moves, I like being King\nIf you like that ballin', I show you what that ballin' be\n\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\n\nFly girl, she named Beatle\nClothes off, she don't need 'em\nAnimals, she don't eat 'em\nHungry for it, I feed her, uh, I feed her\nYou already know that I feed her\nI don't mess with them fuck boys, she said I don't either\nShe said I'm gone eat her, attitude so diva\nGot a big place like Scarface, treat her ass like Elvira\nSkin tone godiva, smokin' on that cheeba\nGirl you got me so hypnotized that thang be givin' me fever\nLet me get it\nTake her to Kauai, fucked on the beach\nFucked on the floor, we ain't gotta speak\nBeach, getting high like a motherfuck\nRoyalty the team so you know what's up\nKitty so good, let me beat it up, kitty so good I could sleep in it\nHollow tip flow sending shots to my enemies\nNiggas who tried to Nick Cannon me\nThoughts were so bad that I pleaded insanity\nBottles, I pop me a case\nLive on the radio bought me a place\nThis is my summer of love\nYea, all these bitches is down\nBut never put nothin' above\n\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\n\nKick it like Kazuya\nThis game is how we maneuver\nThere's plenty fish in the sea and I treat them groupies like grouper\nMy life inside a computer, back up my soul to the cloud\nFunny we show 'em class and they call me the class clown\nMoney is in my jeans, best believe that it's passed down\nGot the room thumpin, she tell me don't stop\nI mean really don't stop\nI must be doing something\nSomething really on point, something really on point\nNow she look back at it\nBut she give me that look when I gotta dip out\nStop being Dramatic (DRAMATIC!)\nCan't nobody do it like this\nForgot her name as soon as I hit\nGot that buzz, the phone was silent\nRun the game, that's us\nFort Knox, gold bars\nLet her get it on both sides, I did it all, with no cosign\nAnd I'm ballin' like I give a fuck\nNow they know wassup\nSmokin' like she wanna fuck\nWe are not in love, she's a grown up\nAnd I'm so childish\nStill that's my bitch\nWe waste our time with all this\n\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby", "image":

grizzle!)\n\nI like smokin' loud, I like being me\nI might drop them bars, that AT&T\nI like makin' moves, I like being King\nIf you like that ballin', I show you what that ballin' be\n\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\n\nFly girl, she named Beatle\nClothes off, she don't need 'em\nAnimals, she don't eat 'em\nHungry for it, I feed her, uh, I feed her\nYou already know that I feed her\nI don't mess with them fuck boys, she said I don't either\nShe said I'm gone eat her, attitude so diva\nGot a big place like Scarface, treat her ass like Elvira\nSkin tone godiva, smokin' on that cheeba\nGirl you got me so hypnotized that thang be givin' me fever\nLet me get it\nTake her to Kauai, fucked on the beach\nFucked on the floor, we ain't gotta speak\nBeach, getting high like a motherfuck\nRoyalty the team so you know what's up\nKitty so good, let me beat it up, kitty so good I could sleep in it\nHollow tip flow sending shots to my enemies\nNiggas who tried to Nick Cannon me\nThoughts were so bad that I pleaded insanity\nBottles, I pop me a case\nLive on the radio bought me a place\nThis is my summer of love\nYea, all these bitches is down\nBut never put nothin' above\n\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\n\nKick it like Kazuya\nThis game is how we maneuver\nThere's plenty fish in the sea and I treat them groupies like grouper\nMy life inside a computer, back up my soul to the cloud\nFunny we show 'em class and they call me the class clown\nMoney is in my jeans, best believe that it's passed down\nGot the room thumpin, she tell me don't stop\nI mean really don't stop\nI must be doing something\nSomething really on point, something really on point\nNow she look back at it\nBut she give me that look when I gotta dip out\nStop being Dramatic (DRAMATIC!)\nCan't nobody do it like this\nForgot her name as soon as I hit\nGot that buzz, the phone was silent\nRun the game, that's us\nFort Knox, gold bars\nLet her get it on both sides, I did it all, with no cosign\nAnd I'm ballin' like I give a fuck\nNow they know wassup\nSmokin' like she wanna fuck\nWe are not in love, she's a grown up\nAnd I'm so childish\nStill that's my bitch\nWe waste our time with all this\n\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby\nMoney baby, money baby, money baby"}}, {"title":

changed\nThe pleasures that I feel\nThey say you never say never, it's real\nElectric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep\nI like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep\nI'd like

good, make it feel good\nMake it feel good, make it feel good, alright\nMake it feel good, make it feel good\n\nNow that we have found this love, baby\nThese haters can't say shit, oh\nI know sometimes it's hard when I'm so far\nI know you miss this di-love\nLet's go somewhere far away, baby\nWhere we don't need no phone, oh\nCause now that we have found this love, baby\nYou'll never be alone, oh oh\n\nWhen your song is on and your hand's in mine\nAnd I'm holding you tight, make it feel good\nLet me hold it down, I'm so glad we found\nIt's whenever you like, make it feel good\n\nMake

time\nMagic happened, nothing was born luckily\nIt's up to me, but\nThen we left\nThe times have changed\nThe pleasures that I feel\nThey say you never say never, it's real\nElectric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep\nI like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep\nI'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room Under the moon, romance\nHold on,

so fly, I'm just being me\nMoved up, weed in my girl clutch\nWhite girls so twelve, never really searched\nSmoke cars, swear to god\nShe need a bigger purse\nRoyalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work\nLay it out on the island\nShe Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in\nThe OG making noise like a firetruck\nFlew in, touched down, then we light 'em up\nI've been saying that the clique\nThere's a lot of us\nThey talk shit but nobody else on top of us\nGot popular, this the real shit\nGet ... in the face with a full clip\nGet ... in the aim, niggas don't slip\nThen get ... with a case just for sellin' it\nI know them gorillas, I hang with them killers\nThey paint 'em as villains\nWhen really they livin', we gotta ball\nThis is world war three, I'm the new Jay-Z\nI ain't write shit down, I'ma steal that crown\nI'ma do that thing\nGirl, you sweeter than mango\nHow we cool and confident with hair like Django?\nHow we walk in the room and the girls they notice?\n'Cause they know you bogus\nI'm the man you noticed\nAnd\n\nWe can go together\nIt doesn't really matter\nWe can get there\nWe can do it if we try\nYou know that I love you\nPut no one else above you\nWe can get there\nWe can do it if we try\n\nI'ma show you how to do this\nIt's easy when you\nLet go, let go\nDidn't mean to make you nervous\nThe booty lookin' retro retro\nYou can be the moon to me\nAnd I can be your spotlight (spotlight)\nAnd if you think I'm ballin'\nYou shoulda seen me last night, last night\nFuck that, fuck ya'll and the po-po's\nDown under, surfin' on the Gold Coast\nI'm looking for the truth in a blunt\nAnd I ain't got a home\nLet's stunt\nSo baby if you feel like you wanna leave\nI ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles\nThe game ain't easy\nWe both deserve a little bit of timeout\n\nWe can go together\nIt doesn't really matter\n(Cough)\nOh\nYeah\n'Kay, one, two, three, go!\nOh, hey\nOh, hey, ah\nOne more time", "image":

no no\n\nWe can go together\nIt doesn't really matter\nWe can get there\nWe can do it if we try\nYou know that I love you\nPut no one else above you\nWe can get there\nWe can do it if we try\n\nYoung Bino in the house like an B&E\nWhy I'm looking so fly, I'm just being me\nMoved up, weed in my girl clutch\nWhite girls so twelve, never really searched\nSmoke cars, swear to god\nShe need a bigger purse\nRoyalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work\nLay it out on the island\nShe Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in\nThe OG making noise like a firetruck\nFlew in, touched down, then we light 'em up\nI've been saying that the clique\nThere's a lot of us\nThey talk shit but nobody else on top of us\nGot popular, this the real shit\nGet ... in the face with a full clip\nGet ... in the aim, niggas don't slip\nThen get ... with a case just for sellin' it\nI know them gorillas, I hang with them killers\nThey paint 'em as villains\nWhen really they livin', we gotta ball\nThis is world war three, I'm the new Jay-Z\nI ain't write shit down, I'ma steal that crown\nI'ma do that thing\nGirl, you sweeter than mango\nHow we cool and confident with hair like Django?\nHow we walk in the room and the girls they notice?\n'Cause they know you bogus\nI'm the man you noticed\nAnd\n\nWe can go together\nIt doesn't really matter\nWe can get there\nWe can do it if we try\nYou know that I love you\nPut no one else above you\nWe can get there\nWe can do it if we try\n\nI'ma show you how to do this\nIt's easy when you\nLet go, let go\nDidn't mean to make you nervous\nThe booty lookin' retro retro\nYou can be the moon to me\nAnd I can be your spotlight (spotlight)\nAnd if you think I'm ballin'\nYou shoulda seen me last night, last night\nFuck that, fuck ya'll and the po-po's\nDown under, surfin' on the Gold Coast\nI'm looking for the truth in a blunt\nAnd I ain't got a home\nLet's stunt\nSo baby if you feel like you wanna leave\nI ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles\nThe game ain't easy\nWe both deserve a little bit of timeout\n\nWe can go together\nIt doesn't really matter\n(Cough)\nOh\nYeah\n'Kay, one, two, three, go!\nOh, hey\nOh, hey, ah\nOne more time"}}, {"title": "The

If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me\n(I'm just playing tho)\n\nLove don't really happen\nLove don't really happen\nLove don't really happen\nLove don't really happen\n\nI think there's

dancing)\nI'm tired of running tired of playing late romancing\n(I don't want to)\nIf we could be together would that make you happy?\n(I don't fuck with that)\nAnd if it wouldn't, tell your

feeling has done to me\nThere's something deep in the air\nJust hope your hands lift me comfortably\n\nI don't know why but every time I see you smiling\nI'm tired of running tired of playing tired of hiding\nIf we could be together would that make you happy?\nAnd If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me\n(I'm just playing tho)\n\nLove don't really happen\nLove don't really happen\nLove don't really happen\nLove don't really happen\n\nI think there's something for us\nLying around as the world comes down\nIf you understand what I'm saying\nYou won't end up in the lost and found, nope\n\nI don't know why but every time I see you dancing\n(I see you dancing)\nI'm tired of running tired of playing late romancing\n(I don't want to)\nIf we could be together would that make you happy?\n(I don't fuck with that)\nAnd if it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me\n\nLove don't really happen\nLove don't really happen\nLove don't really happen\nLove don't really happen\n\nNow why can't every day be like this\nSmoke a  J at the beach like this\nHang with bae at the beach like this\nConversations with Kish like this (hey!)\nNever thought it could be like this\nBe the man like I am like this\nDance around shake your hips like this\nMess around make a hit like this\n\nLike this, like this, no\nAlways be like this, no\nLike this, like this, like this, no\nAlways be like

passing every G  check\nDidn't fuck her for a month and never had a regret\nIt was just nice to have you chilling up in Key West\nAnd we was just chill, I didn't really need sex\nBut really is we

mind, my mind\nAnd them summer days\nNever fade away\nThey just stay the same\nIn my mind, no no\n\nIt's those summer days\nNever fade away\nIt just stays the same\nIn my mind, no no\nIt's those summer days\nNever fade away\nNever, never change\nIn my mind, no no\n\nOkay, Royalty is red hot\nShots from a redbone\nTalking bout her skin tone her color beats headphones\nBaby I'm just living right, and you can say I'm dead wrong\nBut can you disagree with that, Versace on me\nGot gold on the V-neck I'm passing every G  check\nDidn't fuck her for a month and never had a regret\nIt was just nice to have you chilling up in Key West\nAnd we was just chill, I didn't really need sex\nBut really is we fucking yo\nNever serious so I make everything a fucking joke\nShe be pushing buttons and she push it till that button broke\nThen we smoke a blunt and all the drama it go up in smoke\nSee she just graduated got a new job\nTook that nose ring out her nose and went and bought a new Saab\nGot that boyfriend that she living with and she don't smoke no more\nBut, yo, it's cool, I liked her when I knew her back before like\n\nIt's those summer days\nNever fade away\nIt just stays

"lyrics": "One time I was at the beach\nAnd we were looking at the stars\nAnd this girl was laying next to me\nAnd the blanket that we had was,  had stars on it as well\nSo it looked liked we were just floating in an abyss\nHonestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess\nI mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like\nI'll be waiting here on the sand\nI remember that first night\nYou were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt\nSo was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother\nNot as pure, so insecure\nThe times have changed\nBut really we just looked up at the stars\nFor a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars\nThe world was ours it was yours\u2014it was mine\nThe time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of\nLife, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me\nOn this beautiful night\nMaybe we can make things right\nMaybe we can do it without any spite\nIt's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end\nSo we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends\n\nBalling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him\nIf we met bet it would be awkward break out the Sudafed\nCause the flow cold, like a SoCo\nI was smoking smoking John Lennon where my Yoko?\nThis that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet\nVerbal mania, imma show you the illest, get my cousin to kill it\nHad a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out\nGot the top down in the back we could fall out\nWe could fall out, nigga we could fall out\nYour girlfriend push a Prius, she giving me that genius\nMensa, we that Tony Danza\nWine on the rug man you know that shit expensive\nI'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka\nVape so good and the pot like lobster\nNigga, I'm a monster, fuck it, I'm a mon-star\nMan, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car\nThat's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard\nTurn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\n\nI guess this ending's the best for me\nBut I can't leave you behind\nYou know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind\n\nGoddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn\nYo it's kinda hard not to like, get fucking cheesy on this shit\nBut, does that even matter?\nYou know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man\nJuxta-fucking-position\nMy nigga Jaden Smith dropping  jewels and niggas don't believe him cause he's Jaden Smith\nBut it's all about packaging right?\nReal shit though, good and bad is all relative man\nIt really is, a lot of niggas is sheep\nWe don't even know what we like anymore\nWe just know what the most hype is\nShit, do you really like that shit you like?\nOr you like the way they gave it to you?\nYou know what I'm saying?\nPepsi, Coca-Cola same thing\nDave Chapelle said that, the one that taste the best\nWas the one that was paying him the most at the time\nThat's all that happens with us man\nWe some weak niggas man, all of us\nFollowers, sheeps, plural made that shit up\nApologin' ain't no real word my nigga\nWe know this, but he knows more cause he broke the rules that don't even fucking exist man\nFunny thing is man is like, as a futurist\nAnd I can call myself a futurist\nNobody is even going to give a fuck until I'm gone\nSo does it even matter?\nYes it does...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77a2349de407b4d4690746b19b39f6dc.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Childish Gambino",

this girl was laying next to me\nAnd the blanket that we had was,  had stars on it as well\nSo it looked liked we were just floating in an abyss\nHonestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess\nI mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like\nI'll be waiting here on the sand\nI remember that first night\nYou were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt\nSo was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother\nNot as pure, so insecure\nThe times have changed\nBut really we just looked up at the stars\nFor a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars\nThe world was ours it was yours\u2014it was mine\nThe time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of\nLife, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me\nOn this beautiful night\nMaybe we can make things right\nMaybe we can do it without any spite\nIt's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end\nSo we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends\n\nBalling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him\nIf we met bet it would be awkward break out the Sudafed\nCause the flow cold, like a SoCo\nI was smoking smoking John Lennon where my Yoko?\nThis that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet\nVerbal mania, imma show you the illest, get my cousin to kill it\nHad a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out\nGot the top down in the back we could fall out\nWe could fall out, nigga we could fall out\nYour girlfriend push a Prius, she giving me that genius\nMensa, we that Tony Danza\nWine on the rug man you know that shit expensive\nI'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka\nVape so good and the pot like lobster\nNigga, I'm a monster, fuck it, I'm a mon-star\nMan, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car\nThat's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard\nTurn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\nWe are becoming god\n\nI guess this ending's the best for me\nBut I can't leave you behind\nYou know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind\n\nGoddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn\nYo it's kinda hard not to like, get fucking cheesy on this shit\nBut, does that even matter?\nYou know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man\nJuxta-fucking-position\nMy nigga Jaden Smith dropping  jewels and niggas don't believe him cause he's Jaden Smith\nBut it's all about packaging right?\nReal shit though, good and bad is all relative man\nIt really is, a lot of niggas is sheep\nWe don't even know what we like anymore\nWe just know what the most hype is\nShit, do you really like that shit you like?\nOr you like the way they gave it to you?\nYou know what I'm saying?\nPepsi, Coca-Cola same thing\nDave Chapelle said that, the one that taste the best\nWas the one that was paying him the most at the time\nThat's all that happens with us man\nWe some weak niggas man, all of us\nFollowers, sheeps, plural made that shit up\nApologin' ain't no real word my nigga\nWe know this, but he knows more cause he broke the rules that don't even fucking exist man\nFunny thing is man is like, as a futurist\nAnd I can call myself a futurist\nNobody is even going to give a fuck until I'm gone\nSo does it even matter?\nYes it does..."}}, {"title": "Secret Track (V. 3005 - Beach Picnic Version)", "album": null, "year": "2014-10-05", "lyrics": "No matter what you say or what you do\nWhen I'm alone, I'd rather
