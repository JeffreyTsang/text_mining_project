(Ha, I'm in my own school)\nAnd you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs\nI hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended\nIn Search Of... did more for me than Illmatic\nThat's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric\nI made my own shit, you went out and bought yours\nMan, I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic\nLa-di-da-di, I'm going harder\nThan coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers\nWhen it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing\nNamed the album \"Cherry Bomb\" because \"Greatest Hits\" sounded boring\nI don't like to follow the rules\nShe said that I must, I don't have any armpits\nShe wanted to talk; \"Who's in charge of this Golf shit?\"\nI said \"Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant\nAnd who I are isn't really important\nMy heart is as dark as a window with car tint\nSo hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it\nAnd I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick.\"\nIt's young T\n\nI don't like to follow the rules\nAnd that's just who I am\nI hope you understand\nAnd I don't really think y'all cool\nSo give yourself a hand\nNo, no, give yourself a hand\nBetter pose for that camera\nBetter pose, boy you better pose\nAnd it's your life nigga I suppose\nFor the lights, for the camera, and the action\nNow your face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights\nNigga you ask for this life\n\nWelcome to death camp\nYeah, welcome to death camp\nYeah, welcome to death camp\nKissing on my bean bag\nYour lips high-five my tongue\nAnd my fingers moonwalk through your hair\n(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)\nThis is fun I can tell\nI don't know if you'll handle it well\nWelcome to hell camp\n(Lights, and the camera, and the action)\nYou should be mine in a way tonight\n(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d363c1a1794946fc7054c2d292e6abcf.640x640x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler,

with \"book\"\nAnd all them \"books\" is pissed off and had they page in a bunch\nFucking attitude switched just like a \"book\" when it struts\nBut I'm a fraud, I pray to God when the six triple \"book\" bashing\nWhile me and my favorite author's lips tickle\nPeter Parker pick a pack of peppers when the plot thickens\nTyler, The Creator fucking kill you with a popsicle\nCold blooded, so we rock mittens so they won't find him\nNot kidding, keep the Tommy on me; bitch, I'm Ms. Pickles\nSaid I seemed off, last time that team talked\nSick of making niggas cabbage so I took the 'Preme off\nShould've bought some stock in it (Yo, it's fucked up, I get it, put a sock in it)\nNot Golf when the little homies don't\u2014wait, let's weigh my options\nI bought me a mansion, and bought some attention\nAin't give none to Hopsin, and dear Boyce Watkins\nWhy you mad?

you and happy we got laid\nI think about your windows like two times in a day\nI'm a pervert with a purpose, like priest who just got saved\nKissing, kissing, I'm on a mission of licking\nThe holy grail of your body, when you be kissin', Mrs\nThis is a kid from Africa, you, you are a kitchen\nI come quicker than pitches from Sammy Sosa\nYou hoping I'm joking, but first\n\nI'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it\nScreaming \"Stop it,\" don't you fake it, wanna tape it\nGrab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby face\nBut that won't happen 'til I blow my load\n\nYour pussy tighter than door hinges\nI munch you like sandwiches\nBut not any more 'cause I'm on tour, so\nLook: FaceTime your clit, I will jack off my dick\nI go hard, shit, I might need ice pack on my wrist\nFucking, I'm pumping, you know it's coming\nBust in a couple of seconds, I'm sweating, I leave you slump\nIn the back of my truck, butt naked, suck it out of me\nI leave you with nothing, get it?\nThis is what you wanted, this is what you came for\n\nI'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it\nScreaming \"Stop it,\" don't you fake it, wanna tape it\nGrab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby face\nBut that won't happen 'til I blow my load\n\nThere's something 'bout the way you pick your cherries  (You blow me away)\nWith your cherry (Cherry Bomb)\nMake me feel like 4th of July\n(Can't breathe)\nCherry\nYou light my fireworks\nThere's something 'bout the way you pick your cherries  (You blow me away)\nWith your cherry bomb\n\nThat was new music from the soundtrack of the upcoming film \nBe caller eight to win tickets to the triple feature Moon Theatres tonight\nThree back to back to back movies at the Moon Theatres tonight\nBe the eighth caller, only on Golf Radio\nG-O-L-F, G-O-L-F, it's Golf Radio"}}, {"title": "2SEATER", "album": "Cherry Bomb", "year": "2015-04-13", "lyrics": "We can speed in my 2 seater\nGirl I got a 2 seater\nSpeed in my 2 seater\nIn my 2 seater\n\nAbout a hundred on Fax and it's easy to stop\nYou see my shit isn't stock\nI used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls\nSince I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped\nBut I can pay for them all\nAnd by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball\nE92, but '91 the year that Tyler was spawned\nAnd if I crash I'm owing wheels like I'm a Vaughn or a Vince\nTiptronic stick or automatic you pick\nShit is static as shit, sure my shit is a M\nMight get that X6 end, don't follow exit him\nMight take a back street hidden\nHouse got all sports cars like his garage is gym\nTwo sapphires on him neck next his precious gems\nNow AMG it's in boy I will eat him Benz\nNew engine, you got that old shit with those deep rims\nYou got a warranty don't care if you scratchin rims again\n\nWe can speed in my 2 seater\nGirl I got a 2 seater\nSpeed in my 2 seater\nIn my 2 seater\n\nSit in my passenger seat\nYou tell me I got too much speed\nAnd I should slow, I should slow down\nBut I can't, cause you driving me wild\nGirl I get a rush when we're speeding in my car\nAnd sometimes it's too much\nAnd you can feel the beat in my heart\nGirl I get a rush when we're speeding in my car\nAnd sometimes it's too much\n\nI know some dudes that would find you that carry rugers\nAnd shottas, and fucking shoot at your Honda\nThen fucking zoom out in Mazdas\nThem GOLF boys is bad for you like the food from McDonalds\nBoy, I'm a king and I ain't lyin', boy, hakuna matata\nBetter watch for them hyenas if you flex then they swarm\nCashing so many checks they're calling him Tyler O-Comma\nI'm tryna ball like I was Domo O'Connor in '09\nProbably September...\nBoy I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals\nAlbum cover looking like the mascot of the timberwolves\nSkate park at Pemberton\nHoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again\nCause I kill the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman\nTurn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland\nBy pounds, I mean in (beep)\nGive it till he cop brick like a wall with pig in it\nAnd money coming out the blue\nLike cops are changing fits or shit I'm killin' it\n\nBack when Left Brain had the hightop fade\nAnd we would go skate on them concrete waves\nAnd now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump\nThe beat thump, don't get it twisted boy my board's in the trunk (Skate!)\n\nCan you roll my window up?\nThe fuck you turn my music down for, man?\nCan you roll my window up?\nWhy?

stop\nYou see my shit isn't stock\nI used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls\nSince I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped\nBut I can pay for them all\nAnd by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball\nE92, but '91 the year that Tyler was spawned\nAnd if I crash I'm owing wheels like I'm a Vaughn or a Vince\nTiptronic stick or automatic you pick\nShit is static as shit, sure my shit is a M\nMight get that X6 end, don't follow exit him\nMight take a back street hidden\nHouse got all sports cars like his garage is gym\nTwo sapphires on him neck next his precious gems\nNow AMG it's in boy I will eat him Benz\nNew engine, you got that old shit with those deep rims\nYou got a warranty don't care if you scratchin rims again\n\nWe can speed in my 2 seater\nGirl I got a 2 seater\nSpeed in my 2 seater\nIn my 2 seater\n\nSit in my passenger seat\nYou tell me I got too much speed\nAnd I should slow, I should slow down\nBut I can't, cause you driving me wild\nGirl I get a rush when we're speeding in my car\nAnd sometimes it's too much\nAnd you can feel the beat in my heart\nGirl I get a rush when we're speeding in my car\nAnd sometimes it's too much\n\nI know some dudes that would find you that carry rugers\nAnd shottas, and fucking shoot at your Honda\nThen fucking zoom out in Mazdas\nThem GOLF boys is bad for you like the food from McDonalds\nBoy, I'm a king and I ain't lyin', boy, hakuna matata\nBetter watch for them hyenas if you flex then they swarm\nCashing so many checks they're calling him Tyler O-Comma\nI'm tryna ball like I was Domo O'Connor in '09\nProbably September...\nBoy I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals\nAlbum cover looking like the mascot of the timberwolves\nSkate park at Pemberton\nHoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again\nCause I kill the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman\nTurn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland\nBy pounds, I mean in (beep)\nGive it till he cop brick like a wall with pig in it\nAnd money coming out the blue\nLike cops are changing fits or shit I'm killin' it\n\nBack when Left Brain had the hightop fade\nAnd we would go skate on them concrete waves\nAnd now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump\nThe beat thump, don't get it twisted boy my board's in the trunk (Skate!)\n\nCan you roll my window up?\nThe fuck you turn my music down for, man?\nCan you roll my window up?\nWhy? Damn!\nCause it's windy!\nBut I love it when your hair...\n\nBlows, when it blows, when it blows\nWhen your hair blows\nHanging out the sunroof\nI love it when your hair blows\nWhen it blows, when it blows, when it blows\nHanging out the sunroof\nI love it when your hair blows\nWhen it blows, when it blows, when your hair blows\nHanging out the sunroof\nListening to Mac DeMarco\nHanging out the roof window\nSwitch to third gear turbo\nSkrting on these niggas\nSkrting on these bitches\nListening to Mac DeMarco\nHanging out the roof window\nSwitch to third gear turbo\nSkrting on these niggas\nSkrting on these bitches\n\nYou can say you don't want to take that drive\nBut your hair, it blows\nI know we'll have a good time\nYou just gotta stop being scared\nJust roll\nJust come and roll with me\nIt's all good\n\nYeah, man, what's good man, you good? I've been chilling, man. I've been doing some push-ups and shit\nFor real?\n50 a day...Oh w-w-wait...is that that nigga Tyler?\nI think so\nBitch ass nigga, here he comes, man FUCK this nigga, man, this nigga stink... w-wait be quiet, be quiet\n'Ight\nMy nigga, T, man, what's good, man, you good?

sing, whatever look)\nWe met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)\nAnd this is where the story and confusion begin\nCause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't\n\nThere go the police man (Knocking at my door)\nDo I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)\nOr do I answer real confused like (\"I don't know\")\nNow me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)\nShe kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)\nThere's nobody at the door, (Man, I'm so paranoid)\nFuck, 'cause\n\nCause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)\nAnd when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up\nAnd girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young\nThis is more than a crush, I just might be in love\n\nA six year (Difference)\nIs a ten year (Sentence)\nAnd with the (Pigment) on my skin\nI don't want to be another (Statistic)\nYou bring me (Joy, joy, joy, joy)\nAnd you fill a void that was once missing\nAnd (I can say I'm in

bags, go pack your bags)\nI have wings on my back, so we don't (take the plane, have to take the plane)\nGirl, I know you ready, I can see it in your eyes\n(Boy, I know you're not, I can tell you're terrified)\nOh, nobody has to know and if they did, they wouldn't care\n(When you rub my hands switching fifth gear)\nForget about it baby, let's not waste our afternoon (forget about it baby)\nCause we're gonna go fly to the moon (we're gonna go flyin' to the moon)\nYeah, but anyway (Pack your bags, did you pack your bags)\nLeave your crew, bring your coat, cause it\u2019s cold (leave your crew, bring your coat)\n\nGirl, you're so special\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me (ohh)\n\n(Don't you wanna go girl)\n(Let's go, let's go)\n(Right now)\nI think I believe you (Let me show you how girl)\nIt's nice that I need to\nThe earth is so rough I'm not calling your bluff\nWhat, what, what (She would love that)\nI think I believe you\nTake me higher\nLet's make our way over\nTo the Okaga cave\nToday (today)\nThere we will stay,  play it cool now\nX-Y-Z how?\nWelcome me in\nThen we'll begin\n\nSuckin' on my ears, fingers rubbing through your hair\nFastwind, slowwind, fuck yeah, we behaving bad, uh\nProbably couldn't tell but I be blushing when you with me\nWhen you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my Jimmy, oh\nLaying on my trampoline, looking at the stars\nFrom my fake space fog machine\nLaying on my arm, it's dead\nFrom the pressure of your head\nI said I loved you, said it back\nLike it was scripted, but you meant it\nLike the flavor of that lemonade\nThat we was sippin on our sushi-ridden dinner date\nOh, you think you special now?\nOther bitches trippin' now\nCause we're fleeing to the moon\nFuck Earth, man we sick of y'all\nWings on my backs and we ain't gotta cop a ticket, nah, nah, nah\n\nOh yeah\nOh yeah, let's go to the moon!\nOh yeah, let's go to the moon!\nOh yeah (Let's go!)\nOh yeah, let's go to the moon!\nOh yeah, let's go to the moon!\n(Watch this) Let's go to the moon!\nOh yeah\n(Favorite director)\n(Gonna be good)\nCome on, baby\nWhat you wanna do?\n(I\u2019ll be okay)\n(I really like you)\n\nTake me away\nFuck what they say\nTo another place\nAnother day\nWe in outer space\nWe'll waste our days\nSade, Sade, Sade (sade)\nOh, right now (fuck what they say)\nYes!\nLet's go to the
