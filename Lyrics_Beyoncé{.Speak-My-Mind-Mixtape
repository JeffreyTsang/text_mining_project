it means\nCheck it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club\nThrowin a shot down, tryin to stay above\nGround, another ground-breakin day in the club\nSurrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut\nReminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in\nNo watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems\nMissin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes\nDue to the fast life we told wonderful lies\nOn how we would live forever, time proved us wrong\nHad to get our shit together and move it along\nHad dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas\nDrivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm\nWishing on a star to follow where you are\nI'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means\nWas interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit\nBack in the days when I was movin much shit, \"What up chick?\"\nMaintanin, it's the same old thang\nA little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed\nI see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement\nRemember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down\nWhile the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down\nJust to earn a rep, but what good is it now?\nShe said \"Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye\"\nI was too deep for you from day one\nThats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone\nI'm wishing on a star to follow where you are\nI'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means\nAnd I wish on all the rainbows that I see\nI wish on all the people who really dream\nAnd I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come\nAnd I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done\nUh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks\nRun, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark\nWanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample\nDangerous games we played on the third rail\nFiend for the summer breeze\nHopped out the Lee's Dungrares\nInto the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports\nTo take us away from here, but I cut too much\nSo I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush\nMy sinners used to back me up\nLike Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me\nAll my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll\nLet's reach for the stars now... Jigga!\nI'm wishing on a star to follow where you are\nI'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means\nAnd I wish on all the rainbows that I see\nI wish on all the people who really dream\nAnd I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come\nAnd I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9bcd362c8c7d317f8f120f197cdecd1d.300x300x1.jpg", "artist":

means\nCheck it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club\nThrowin a shot down, tryin to stay above\nGround, another ground-breakin day in the club\nSurrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut\nReminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in\nNo watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems\nMissin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes\nDue to the fast life we told wonderful lies\nOn how we would live forever, time proved us wrong\nHad to get our shit together and move it along\nHad dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas\nDrivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm\nWishing on a star to follow where you are\nI'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means\nWas interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit\nBack in the days when I was movin much shit, \"What up chick?\"\nMaintanin, it's the same old thang\nA little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed\nI see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement\nRemember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down\nWhile the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down\nJust to earn a rep, but what good is it now?\nShe said \"Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye\"\nI was too deep for you from day one\nThats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone\nI'm wishing on a star to follow where you are\nI'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means\nAnd I wish on all the rainbows that I see\nI wish on all the people who really dream\nAnd I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come\nAnd I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done\nUh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks\nRun, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark\nWanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample\nDangerous games we played on the third rail\nFiend for the summer breeze\nHopped out the Lee's Dungrares\nInto the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports\nTo take us away from here, but I cut too much\nSo I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush\nMy sinners used to back me up\nLike Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me\nAll my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll\nLet's reach for the stars now... Jigga!\nI'm wishing on a star to follow where you are\nI'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means\nAnd I wish on all the rainbows that I see\nI wish on all the people who really dream\nAnd I'm

need cheese and sprouts\nSo I could continue to hold down the foundation\nIt's pitiful how you could charge me with violations\nPatience is the key, fuck the frustrations\nWe act off our emotions and we start hatin'\nAnd that leads to stress, problems and weight loss\nTotal baldness, broke homes come from negative forces\nBaby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out\nWhen it come,

I'm sorry..\nJust you know, that you got mature... shoot..\nYa'll ladies keep your mouth shut right now\nCuz ya'll don't know what y'all talking about\nThis between me and her, that's my word, she just upset\n\nChanges... we all go through changes\nArguments, disagreements, and to some it's dangerous\nBut your mind and your heart's clogged with all your pain and\nBut a bond that we was holding, what made us famous\nHey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone\nStop cryin', come talk to Tone\nTell me everything that's goin' wrong like your needs and doubts\nMy reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts\nSo I could continue to hold down the foundation\nIt's pitiful how you could charge me with violations\nPatience is the key, fuck the frustrations\nWe act off our emotions and we start hatin'\nAnd that leads to stress, problems and weight loss\nTotal baldness, broke homes come from negative forces\nBaby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out\nWhen it come, babe, I'm goin' all out\nIt's T-O-N-E-Y, to Beyonce, my, sweetie pie\nPlease try, be mine til we die\n\n\nBeyonce.. beautiful girl"}}, {"title": "Crazy Feelings", "album": "Da Real World", "year":

morning\nFever all through the night\n\nEverybody's got the fever\nThat is something you outta know\nFever isn't such a new thing\nFever started long ago\n\nRomeo loved Juliet\nJuliet felt the same\nWhen he put his arms around her\nHe said to Julie \"Baby you're my flame\"\nHe givest fever\nWhen we kisseth\nFever with my flaming youth\nFever, I'm on fire\nFever, yeah I burn forsooth\n\nCaptain Smith and Pocahontas\nHad a very mad affair\nWhen her daddy tried to kill him\nShe said \"Daddy, oh don't you dare\"\nHe gives me fever\nWith his kisses\nFever when he holds me tight\nFever, I'm his misses\nDaddy won't you treat him right\n\nNow you've listened to my story\nHere's the point that I have made\nCats were born to give chicks fever\nBe it fahrenheit or centigrade\nThey give ya fever\nWhen we kiss ya\nFever if you live and learn\nFever until you sizzle\nWhat a lovely way to burn\nWhat a lovely way to burn\nWhat a lovely way to burn\nWhat a lovely way

the way\nBut it's my first time\nAnd baby I know you wanna change the speed\nAnd I'ma let you take the lead remember it's my first time\n\nArm in arm eye to eye\nAs the music plays emotions rise\nI think I'm ready\nIn your eyes I see three words\nHold me tight 'cause I'm about to burst\nI think I'm ready\nI feel it in my chest as I dance with you\nGot so much control you haven't made a move\nYou

I wish on all the rainbows that I see\nI wish on all the people who really dream\nAnd I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes\nAnd I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done\nI never thought I'd see a time when you would be\nSo far away from home\nSo far away from me\nJust think of all the moments that we can spend\nI just can't let you go from me, we were meant\nI didn't mean to hurt you, but I know\nIn the game of love, you reap what you sow\nI feel it's time we should make up baby\nI feel it's time for us to get back together\nAnd make the best of things, oh baby\nWhen we're together\nWhether or never\nI feel it's time we should make up baby\nI feel it's time for us to get back together\nAnd make the best of things, oh baby\nWhen we're together\n(Let's get together, baby)\nWhether or never\nAnd I'm wishin on a star\nTo follow where you are\nAnd I'm wishing on a dream"}}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
